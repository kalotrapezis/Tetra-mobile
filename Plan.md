# Plan — the common notepad (every agent reads this first)

The user, 17 Oct 2026: one place where every agent (Claude session) sees what is planned, what is being done, what
is done and what was decided against. **Read it before starting; write here when you start, finish or drop
something.** Details stay where they live (HANDOFF.md for how things were built, OFFICE_FEATURES.md for what Office
can do, SYNC_PLAN.md for sync's rules, TEST_TREE.md for checks); this file is the list and the state.

How to write here:
- `- [ ]` planned · `- [~] (session name, date)` being done now · `- [x] (commit)` done · `- [-] (why)` dropped.
- One line per item where possible; the date as "17 Oct". Never delete the user's words; move done items down
  rather than erase them. Commit only this file's lines you wrote (other sessions edit it too).
- The user's own original wishlist (Sept 2026) is at the bottom, unchanged.

## Now — who is doing what
- [~] (system-userspace session, 29 Oct; branches `claude/system-userspace` here and `system-userspace` in Drive; not merged, not pushed,
      not installed, the move not run on the real folders) **Files and Photos are the user's own** (the user: "Make Tetra process
      everything from the system folder; Files and Photos to be userspace only"). Calendar, Contacts, Data, Phone, Timer, Maps (all
      of it) and Files' Trash → `.System/<App>/Shared`; .notes → Notes/Shared; the phone's .templates → Office/Data; From computer,
      From phone and AI Assist's pictures stay in Files (they are the user's). Sync's names unchanged ("Calendar/…"), each device
      maps them to its disk, so mixed versions sync in any order (SYNC_PLAN.md 6av). The move: by renaming, once a device, at the
      first start (Android: the first TetraFolder.root). Sync's identical "(n)" copies → `.System/Backups/Data/Sync copies/<date>/`,
      the rest listed there. Reset backs up and deletes the apps' Shared as it did their Files folders. Skills read the new place
      (the old one until Tetra moved it). Table: Drive's desktop/SYSTEM.md. Tests: TetraSystemTest, desktop system/files/sync tests.
- [~] (assistant session, 29 Oct; branch `claude/assistant`, worktree Drive-Android-worktrees/assistant; not merged) **Tetra Assistant**
      (the user: a phone voice assistant in place of ChatGPT and the keyboard, acting on Tetra's own data; walkie-talkie, not live; no
      cloud connectors: the model is online, the tools run on the phone). Assistant.kt: Mistral chat (`mistral-small-latest`) with 14
      function tools that bridge into CalendarFiles, TimerFiles, NotesStore, DriveRules.allItems and ContactsFiles; tools answer the
      model names/titles only (never numbers, bodies or whole lists); web search and pictures through Mistral's Conversations API
      (`web_search`, `image_generation`, store=false; the chat API does not run them), pictures saved in Tetra/Assistant. Voxtral
      (`voxtral-small-transcribe-3`, el) for speech, an energy VAD ported from the VOICE app. A call waits for a tap or a spoken "ναι"
      heard by the phone, never the model. AssistantScreen.kt: the chat (Home › Assistant, read aloud on the speaker button) and the
      sheet over any app (AssistantSheetActivity, translucent): listens at once, answers aloud, re-opens the mic for a question or a
      list, closes; the sheet's conversation is forgotten a minute after the last words. AssistantVoice.kt: the key (AndroidKeyStore
      AES-GCM), HTTPS with Greek errors, VoiceInteractionService + session service + a Voxtral RecognitionService (Android requires one
      of an assistant), Settings › Assistant (the role cannot be requested: the button opens Android's page). App icon "Tetra
      Assistant" (Settings › App icons) opens the sheet: the fallback where the power button stays Google's. Strings in all 24 languages
      (22 by a Sonnet helper, unchecked by native readers). AssistantTest (9). **Not tried on a device or against Mistral** (no key here).
      Then (the user, same day): named **AI Assist**, the user's own icon (Assets/Icons/Applets/AIAssistant.png); the thread's running
      cost in the top bar (Bill: Mistral's list prices in $, hand-kept; tools' prices from price tables, not Mistral's page); **My words**
      (Settings › AI Assist, Voxtral context_bias, prefilled) and a switch, off, adding up to 50 favourite contacts' names; **Live** (the
      waveform button): Voxtral realtime (`voxtral-mini-transcribe-realtime-3`) over a WebSocket with the key — no server of Tetra's;
      Mistral's voice-agent SDK needs LiveKit, so not used — its turn detection hands each turn to the same chat and tools; answers read
      by the phone's own voice (free) with the mic sending silence meanwhile; a vinyl record turns with the talk (the icon its label),
      captions, X and "cost / time"; ends by itself after 20 s of silence or at 5 minutes. Live's realtime messages not tried against
      Mistral (no key here): the protocol is from the docs page only.
      Then (the user tried it on the phone: "the voice is bad and slow"): the chat answer streams (SSE) and is read a sentence at a
      time (Sentences) by **Mistral's voice** (`voxtral-mini-tts-3`, streamed float PCM 24 kHz, AnswerVoice: the next sentence made
      while one plays), the phone's voice kept as the free choice (Settings › AI Assist › Voice, all of Mistral's voices, a tap reads
      a sample); TTS characters on the bill. **Relations** ("η αδερφή μου"): relation_remember/forget and contacts_find(relation) on
      the user's own card's X-ABRELATEDNAMES; which card is the user's is asked once (my_card) and kept in this phone's prefs.
      Live: a **tonearm** that moves to another track when the AI talks; a **cassette** a tap away (the tape winds one way for the
      user, back for the AI). Installed on the Xiaomi 15.
      Then (the user, 29 Oct evening): a **money counter** in Settings › AI Assist, a trip meter beside an odometer: "Since <date>"
      with Reset (asks once, keeps the history), the total since the start, the past trips listed. Every Bill also counts into
      AssistantMeter (prefs "assistant_meter", apart from the chats), including the keyboard's voice input and the voice samples.
      Then (the user, after a day's use: "the commands work very well"): the voice and the mic on the phone when the only Bluetooth
      sound device is Tetra's own computer (AssistantAudio; it had played on the PC through the call relay's link); a **pause time**
      (Settings, 1–6 s, 2.5 by default; live's turn detection min_silence_ms too); a "make it the assistant" card on the screen
      until it is; calls take the number marked default; **new tools**: note_new, note_open (notes_search now reads whole notes),
      navigate (Tetra Maps, offline: a place, an address or a contact's address kept on the phone), photos_place (Photos' place
      names, else 15 km around the map's match), youtube (the app on a search); contacts_find by keywords (κομμωτ, κουρε → "Στέλλα
      κούρεμα") and the user's own custom relations. MainActivity takes "note:", "maps-go:", "maps-search:" in Applet.EXTRA.
      Later: photos, send-to-PC, an offline model, keeping chats; the "me" card in the card itself once the computer needs it.
- [x] (data-refresh session, 29 Oct; branch `claude/data-background-refresh`, merged into `claude/assistant`) **Data refreshes and sends with the
      app closed** (the user: Data "never refreshes or sends unless I open it"): SyncJob's 30-minute job runs DataStats.refresh (the screen's look)
      and sends the "data" part inside the job. Open: not yet run on the phone (AI Assist build on it).
- [~] (call-sound session, 29 Oct; branches `claude/call-sound-where-answered` here (merged into `claude/assistant`) and `call-sound-where-answered` in Drive; not pushed)
      **A call's sound where it was answered** (the user: "where I answer the call, the sound goes there"). Cause: the computer holds the
      phone on its Bluetooth as a hands-free kit (calls) **and** as a speaker (A2DP media), so Android sent every call and all media there.
      Phone (Tetra the phone app): PhoneCalls remembers where a call was taken (its screen, notification, raise-to-ear, dialled → phone;
      the bubble's Answer, a call the computer placed → computer) and keep() moves the sound there (up to 3 tries a call; earbuds/car win
      over the earpiece; a way picked by hand wins over all). The computer is told apart by its Bluetooth name = a paired peer's name
      (PhoneRoutes.isComputer; BLUETOOTH_CONNECT now asked with the other call permissions). Call screen: "To the computer" / "To the phone"
      above the buttons while the computer is on the phone's Bluetooth; the bubble: the same as an icon (`phone`/`computer` actions,
      route "computer" in /call/state; echo canceller only while the sound is here). Media: the desktop drops the phone's A2DP Audio
      Source (bluetoothctl disconnect <mac> 0000110a-…) on connect and each 30 s look; tried by hand on the real pair 29 Oct: A2DP off,
      Handsfree kept, media on the phone's speaker, not back after 45 s. Tablet: cannot take a call's sound (no app can be a hands-free
      kit; the Wi-Fi relay is computer-to-computer only), so no "To the tablet". **Open:** no real call tried (no build installed: the
      phone has release beta.4); without Tetra as the phone app nothing moves a call's sound (no public lever), only the media fix holds.
- [~] (system-folder session, 27 Oct; branches `system-folder` in Drive and `claude/system-folder` here; not merged, not pushed)
      **One hidden ~/Tetra/.System** (the user: "gather all of these under one system folder, and make it hidden: .System"; "every
      app/data, app/core, app/user"; "the builder … clean up after itself, every time the same way"). Desktop system.js makes every
      path: .System/<App>/{Data,Tools,Cache,Temp}, rules in Drive's desktop/SYSTEM.md. ~/Tetra-maps → Maps/Data (bin → Maps/Tools,
      geofabrik-index.json → Maps/Cache), ~/Tetra-backups → Backups/Data, moved by rename at the first start of the new desktop.
      The map builder cleans its Temp and half-copied files however a build ends. Reset keeps .System; sync never sees it.
      tools/maps-greece.sh and MapsTest read the new paths. Then (the user: "Tetra should have a cleaner"): desktop Settings › Clean up
      (cleaner.js): each app's .System Temp and Cache, Files history past 30 days (also pruned by itself daily), thumbnails without a
      photo (server, after a scan), the Sept safety copies moved to Backups/Data, routing work of removed maps; Reset says .System
      stays; the builder's Retry no longer sends `resume`. Later, not built: the same cleaner on the phone and tablet (cacheDir's
      nanoTime temp files from Slides/Writer, *-drafts, writer-history, logs/ and drive traces, filesDir/Files history).
      Waiting: the user's review and merge.
- [~] (beta-release session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/admiring-pare-6a6a4a` here and `beta-release` in Drive; the site merged and pushed
      27 Oct at the user's yes, live at kalotrapezis.github.io/Drive-Android in the 24 EU languages. Then .System, the desktop's
      Clean up and Notes as Markdown (agents' branches) merged as Android 0.6.0-beta.4 / desktop 0.6.0-beta.32; beta.3/beta.31 never
      went out (rain). The user: upload at 03:00 one file at a time, publish, switch the site; install on the devices in the morning)
      **The next beta for Linux and Android, and the site** (the user: "Are we ready to publish the new Beta For Linux and Android …
      AppImage for most Linux distros and Android 11+"; then, mid-way: "don't build packages yet just make the page"). Ready check:
      every finished branch is in main in both repos (Drive's old unmerged-looking branches are pre-scrub copies whose content is in
      main); 687 Android unit (12 skipped) / 171 desktop tests pass, `npm run check` clean. **The page done**: docs/index.html and
      el.html — each card is a picture without words (docs/img/art, made by tools/site-cards.py: the old cards with their text painted
      over, new screenshots in device frames) with its words as HTML laid over it, so a language is a text change; new cards: map
      builder, routes across borders, guide, 24 languages, Phone on a tablet; Maps no longer "Greece only" (photos by place still are);
      the speed card is HTML bars. READMEs of both repos: the site's English cards rendered (Assets/cards). Screenshots: desktop from
      source on a scratch profile with invented files and the real (public) map files; Android on the tetra_shots emulator's sample
      data. Download links stay on the published releases (Android beta 2, desktop beta 23) until new ones exist. **Built before the
      user's stop, not published or installed**: Android 0.6.0-beta.3 (versionCode 14, release key 9D:FF:81…D3:97), desktop
      0.6.0-beta.31 .deb + AppImage (now on the static AppImage runtime: no libfuse2 needed; started and rendered from the AppImage,
      bundled Java 17 and Python+osmium run; a route from inside it not finished). Open: the release APK not run on a device; the
      Greek site text reviewed by no native reader beyond this session. Then (the user): the 22 other EU languages (Haiku, from
      tools/site-strings.py's phrase lists, kept in tools/site-strings/), the browser's language chosen on the English page (not the
      country: nothing is sent anywhere), downloads grouped under the Android robot (with a QR code to the APK, to be remade at each
      release) and the Linux penguin, and Questions (first: installing an app from outside the Play Store). Unchecked by native readers:
      Android's install-screen and GNOME Files words in the FAQ, Maltese most of all.
- [x] (maps-borders session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/optimistic-noyce-f83551` here and `maps-borders` in Drive, not merged) **Routes across
      borders on each country's own graph, through the border crossings** (the user: "When we have both the neighbouring maps, it should
      be able to cross the border"; then "Drive to the edge and then start from the other edge"; "at the border … the main road", not
      "through the fields"; "three or more one by one so we don't need AI level of memory"). Replaces the pair graphs merged earlier today
      (`<a>_<b>-gh`, hours to build, 786 MB each). The desktop map builder's step **borders** (after install, seconds) writes
      `<a>_<b>-crossings.tsv` for each neighbour (Geofabrik .poly borders that meet), and for any two maps here that have none yet, so one
      Remake joins maps made before: maps-tools/maps-crossings.py reads both regions' .osm.pbf (kept in ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Data/osm, else downloaded
      again) — the barrier=border_control points on car roads both hold, else (an open border) their main roads, up to four points a
      crossing (a station's lanes: one point on the wrong lane turned the route round). Routing (Android MapsFiles.legs + MapsRouting.routes,
      desktop maps.legs + main.js maps:route): within one map exactly as before; else the maps on the way (fewest borders, any number),
      the five crossings nearest the way (three through a third country) timed on both sides, the fastest kept, each leg on its own graph,
      joined as one route. Up to three graphs open (phone) / GraphHopper servers (desktop). Checked on the real GR, MK, BG graphs: Thessaloniki
      → Skopje 222.9 km, 188 min by Evzonoi (as the pair graph); → Sofia 286 km by Promachonas; Athens → Plovdiv by Nymfaia; Thessaloniki →
      Sofia forced through North Macedonia 343 min; a real Remake of North Macedonia beside GR and BG: 9.5 min, its crossings step
      2 min 20 s, all three crossings files, the same routes on them; 687 Android unit / 171 desktop tests. **Open:** the pair graph greece_macedonia-gh in
      Files/Maps and on the phone is no longer read (the main session removes it); a route through three countries tries fewer crossings;
      nothing tried on the phone/tablet.
      Before (superseded): (maps-borders session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/optimistic-noyce-f83551` here and `maps-borders` in Drive, main merged into both;
        not merged into main) **A route crosses from one installed map into its neighbour** (the user: "When we have both the neighbouring
        maps, it should be able to cross the border"; then: one graph of every map "would need a supercomputer", "break it into pieces",
        "use all the cores", "1 to several hours … please be patient", "if it's some 4 GB potato, grey it out"). **One graph a pair of
        neighbours**, `<a>_<b>-gh` in Files/Maps (ids sorted: greece_macedonia-gh). Desktop map builder: a step **borders** after install;
        neighbours are the maps here whose Geofabrik .poly meets the new one's (kept in ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Data/osm with each region's .osm.pbf;
        Greece's pbf: maps-greece.sh's); each pair streamed together (maps-tools/maps-merge.py, pyosmium zip_processors: 3.5 min, 330 MB
        for GR+MK) and imported with every core; each pair its own .done mark (Try again goes on at the next pair); a pair needing more
        than 60% of the computer's memory (12 × both files) is left out with a line saying so. The wizard says beforehand that the map is
        minutes to an hour and joining it with its neighbours hours, with the memory; while building, a line per pair (24 languages).
        Remove takes the map's pairs. Routing: `MapsFiles.graphFor` (inside MapsRouting.routes, so no caller changed) and desktop
        `maps.graphFor`: from one map into the other on their pair graph, within one map exactly as before; two maps not joined or a third
        country fail in words (maps_error_not_joined / maps.notJoined). `graphAt` keeps an open pair graph while it holds the map at the
        point, so speed limits on the way open no other graph (seconds on a phone). Checked: Thessaloniki → Skopje 223 km, 187 min on the
        phone's code path (MapsBorderTest with TETRA_MAPS) and through router.js; Thessaloniki → Athens still greece-gh, 470.6 km;
        neighbours from the real borders: GR–MK, GR–BG, GR–AL, GR–TR, MK–BG, MK–AL, MK–RS, BG–TR, BG–RS (not Cyprus, not Italy);
        a real builder run (North Macedonia beside Greece, scratch Files/Maps): the map 6 min, the pair 47 min, then the same route on
        its graph; 686 Android unit / 170 desktop tests pass. **Costs:** a pair graph is about both maps' graphs (GR+MK 786 MB) on the
        phone too; every core did not make the pair faster than 3 threads (48 min): memory-bound here (13 GB, swapping). **Open:** a route through three countries; the phone's Settings › Maps does not
        count the pair graphs' size; nothing tried on the phone/tablet.
- [x] (directions-languages session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/reverent-lederberg-489439` here (20155551) and `directions-languages` in Drive
      (dfc246a), not merged) **Maps' directions in every language Tetra has** (the user: "Why it's only Greek? Isn't that an Android
      feature? It shouldn't be hard to be in all the languages we have."): Tetra's own words (warnings, lanes, bends, stops, tolls,
      parking, errors, ferry, "towards") are strings in all 24 (`Words` in MapsGuide.kt; JVM tests read the real files, TestWords.kt);
      GraphHopper's turn words asked in the chosen language (`MapsRouting.translation`), Tetra's own lines in GraphHopper's format
      (app/src/main/resources/tetra/graphhopper/<lang>.txt) for what 10.2 lacks: et, ga, lv, mt whole, "toward" etc. for es fi hr lt nl
      pt ro sl; Portuguese is Portugal's. Settings › Maps › Directions in lists the 24 (the app's language by default). No voice for it on
      the phone: a dialog once (car: a toast) with Voice settings. Miles + feet (US) / yards (UK) by the phone's region (Android's
      measurement system), spoken, on the turn card and the car's screen. Desktop router.js asks in the app's language. Greek wording
      unchanged. 675 Android unit / 164 desktop tests pass. **Not seen on a device** (voices, the dialog, the car's miles); the desktop
      gets English for et/ga/lv/mt and GraphHopper's gaps (its server can't take Tetra's files) and still shows km. Then (the user
      approved): a half (1.5 km) takes its CLDR category by android.icu — a whole number of that category, or maps_in_km/mi_fraction
      where none has it (cs, sk, lt "many", pl "other"); ro, sl, fr, da were off too. Checked in all 24 against ICU (icu4j, tests only).
- [x] (map-age session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/nifty-cohen-161677` here and `map-age` in Drive, not merged) **Old maps say so; the
      map follows the country** (the user: "a notification right next to these buttons … a system notification, and a button to call
      for an update or a remake, because we make the maps, we don't simply update them"). A map is old 3 months after its <id>.json
      "built" (Greece's older pack: its .pmtiles date) — MapsFiles.isOld / mapbuild.js isOld. Desktop Settings › Maps: "Over 3 months
      old" beside the buttons, Update is now **Remake** (mapsBuild, fresh downloads); a notification once per map per time it is due
      (setting mapsOldSaid, 30 s after start and every 6 h), its click opens Settings › Maps. Phone/tablet Settings › Maps: the same
      note and "Remake it on the computer"; an Android notification once (MapsAge, at start and with the Calendar's quarter-hourly
      look), a tap opens Settings › Maps. Roundabout picture clockwise on a left-driving map (ringSweep, MapsFiles.driveLeftAt at the
      junction). Map names in Tetra's language (labelsIn: name:<lang> and its script in Protomaps' style, Greek unchanged; the road
      under a tap too), phone and desktop. 24 languages. 674 Android unit / 165 desktop tests pass; desktop screenshots (Greek and
      German, a hidden copy on a scratch profile). **Open:** not seen on the phone/tablet; the desktop notification's click not tried;
      a point inside two maps' bounds takes the first map's side; Android Auto's unused maneuver() still says CCW.
- [x] (call-speaker session, 27 Oct; merged into main in both repos; branches `claude/frosty-jemison-a4b00a` here and `call-speaker` in Drive) **The computer's call bubble has a
      phone-speaker button** (the user: "the call pop up on the PC from the phone to have a speaker option so instead of hearing the call from
      bluetooth to my PC to hear it from the phone's speaker"). Bubble: a speaker icon (while Tetra is the phone app, as Mute/Hold) sends
      `speaker`/`unspeaker` the way Mute travels (sync.js callAction → SyncServer /call/action → PhoneCalls.act → setAudioRoute); the phone
      reports its route in /call/state ("route"), the bubble's sound line says "Sound on the phone's loudspeaker", recording is off there.
      Back: the Bluetooth device it was on (the computer), else Bluetooth, else the earpiece. Fixed on the way: SyncServer /call/action
      read 8 characters ("unspeaker" is 9). Not done: the tablet's relayed call notification has no Speaker action.
      **Then (the user, 27 Oct evening): "I go to the phone and click to go to speaker or back to the phone and it did not work".** Telecom's
      log: Tetra's six taps arrived and HyperOS refused each ("use google dialer for relay call, can not set audio route"): a call answered on
      the computer's Bluetooth (PipeWire's org.pipewire.Telephony answers it there) is a Xiaomi "relay call", and its Telecom
      (MiCallRelayStub.shouldLimitButton, read from the phone's own Telecom.apk) refuses CallsManager.setAudioRoute, mute, hold, unhold,
      conference and add-call to any phone app but Google's. CallEndpointController.requestCallEndpointChange has no such check, so every
      route change (call screen and bubble) goes through Android 14's call endpoints first (`PhoneCalls.route`), the old way if refused, and
      writer.log says when the sound did not move. A call the PC places is not a relay call (seen, 19:15). **Open:** Mute and Hold on such a
      call stay refused (no other door); not yet seen on a real incoming call answered on the PC (no second phone to call with).
      Also the bubble that came back for ever (the user: "if the other side ended the call and I was fast enough to click it too it got
      stuck on the PC open and even if i closed it would reopen for ever"): the phone sends each state on its own thread, so an "active"
      could land after the "ended", and watch() reopened the bubble every 30 s. Now states older than the last (the phone's `at`) are
      dropped, a bubble closed by hand stays closed until the phone says something new, End/Decline the phone did not hear still ends it.
      687 Android unit / 173 desktop tests pass; the phone has the build (phone-install.sh, 19:10).
- [x] (phone-country session, 27 Oct; branches `claude/awesome-goldwasser-472e81` here and `phone-country` in Drive, not merged)
      **A number without + or 00 is the phone's own country's, not Greek** (the user: "Greece is +30 or 0030. All the other
      countries have their own codes. They are standard. Use them."). Android: libphonenumber 9.0.42 (Apache-2.0, 360 KB, the
      release maps-phone.py reads) — `PhoneCountry.of` is the SIM's country, else the network's, else the system's;
      `PhoneArea.of/place`, the spam list's ranges and CallInsider (Greek numbers only) read numbers in it: Mobile / Landline from
      libphonenumber's types (a US number, either: its place or nothing), Abroad = another country than the SIM's; Germany's
      0171… is +49171…, Italy's 06… keeps its 0, the US's 011 is its way out. The phone sends its country with each call's state;
      the desktop (libphonenumber-js, MIT) keeps it as the phoneCountry setting, else the computer's locale, for its spam list.
      Unit tests both sides. **Not tried on a device**: needs a call (or Recents) on the phone to see the labels and screening.
      Left as it was: contacts still match by the last nine digits (no country in it); PDF › Redact's phone pattern is Greek.
- [x] (phone-area-codes session, 27 Oct; merged into main) **The Phone names every landline's place from
      the installed maps** (the user: "could we take that into maps to get the codes for the map the user has installed?";
      "it has to be built side by side with map manager so with the map gets the numbers as well"): each map gets
      `<id>-phone.tsv` (tools/maps-phone.py, libphonenumber's geocoding data, Apache-2.0: prefix with the country code →
      the place, en first, then every language libphonenumber has); `PhoneArea.label` reads the tables beside the
      installed maps (a table without its .pmtiles is not read), the longest prefix wins, the app's language else English;
      Mobile / Landline / Abroad stay the fallback. The 10 city strings went (place names are data). The desktop map
      builder writes the table in its search step: commit on Drive's `claude/map-builder` (merges with it); maps-greece.sh
      too; Greece's table put in the computer's Files/Maps, so sync carries it before any rebuild. 669 unit tests pass;
      tablet (Greek): 2313012345 → Θεσσαλονίκη, 2231012345 → Λαμία (the table pushed there by adb: the tablet was off
      the computer's Wi-Fi). **Open:** the builder's phone step not run inside the app (maps-phone.py run alone for GR
      and BE); a number without +/00 is taken as Greek; a +1 or +7 map names all of its code's areas.
- [x] (phone-tablet-two-pane session, 27 Oct; branch `claude/phone-tablet-two-pane-5f7348`, not merged: main's checkout holds the map-manager
      session's uncommitted work in the same files) **Phone on the tablet: two panes** (the user: "now it's just black bars everywhere"):
      the list on the left, the keypad always open on the right (smallest width ≥ 600 dp; the phone unchanged); seen on the tablet,
      landscape and portrait, typing and T9 search. Then (the user): **Call blocking** and **Speed dial** are their own pages behind
      two buttons in the Phone's sheet (Call blocking: the spam list and the blocked calls, a tap opens the call); **Raise to answer**
      and **Turn over to silence** (PhoneGestures, while ringing, both off at first; Settings › Phone and the sheet); 24 languages.
      Merged into main 27 Oct. Then (the user): Call blocking is one list as Contacts (every number and range on the spam list,
      whether it called or not; the add field on top), a tap opens its card: Unblock (a range's line goes), its call history,
      its recordings; the sheet's two buttons side by side; Notify silently (a quiet notification when a blocked number calls, a
      tap opens its card; on the phone only). Seen on the tablet; the notification itself not seen (needs a blocked call).
      **Open:** Unblock not pressed on a device (it would unblock a real number); the gestures need a real call on the phone;
      the keypad pane's upper part is empty until a number is typed.
- [~] (map-manager session, 27 Oct; merged into main in both repos 27 Oct; a real build still to be tested with the user) **Map manager: maps of any country, made by the user's own computer** (the user:
      "In the maps settings page add a map manager, responsible for downloading and updating Maps per county"; then "if we have B
      they could sync the maps to their phone or tablet, we can make a guide for that as well. so the maintenance goes to the user
      not me. Its an app not a service"). No ready packs online: desktop Tetra › Settings › Maps › Map manager picks a Geofabrik
      region and builds its pack (map, routing, search, lanes) into Files/Maps as <id>.pmtiles, <id>-gh/, <id>-*.tsv, <id>.json —
      Greece is the pack "greece" already; sync carries it; the phone's Settings › Maps lists, removes and explains; a guide.
      Built (on the branch): desktop mapbuild.js + src/MapBuilder.tsx — Settings › Maps card (each map: size, date, Update,
      Remove) and the wizard: credits with Donate (OpenStreetMap, Protomaps, MapLibre; GraphHopper, Geofabrik linked), a
      country or region of Geofabrik's list (download size, memory needed, its parts when too big), the system packages it
      lacks (openjdk-17-jre-headless, python3-pyosmium) explained with Install — pkexec's own password window — and "I don't
      want", the steps with progress, done; pmtiles and the GraphHopper jar fetched into ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Tools. Desktop maps.js,
      main.js: a source a map (layers interleaved), search/addresses/streets of every map, routing on the map the route
      starts in. Android: MapsFiles.ids/maps/graphAt/lists/removeMap, mapStyle over every map, the camera over them all,
      Settings › Maps lists each map with Remove. 24 languages both sides. Tests: MapsPacksTest, test/mapbuild.test.js.
      **Open:** a route across a border (one map's graph a route); roundabouts drawn the Greek way on a left-driving map
      (the manifest has "drive"); directions' words still Greek/English only; a real build not yet run (the user's password).
- [x] (office-media session, 27 Oct; branch `claude/office-media`, not merged; its build is on the tablet 971f6b37) **Local video and audio
      embedded in documents play** (the user: "I know it has Video from YouTube but what about local files embedded into the
      documents?"). Already there: Slides read and played PowerPoint's p:videoFile/p:audioFile + p14:media and Impress's
      draw:plugin; Words its own films and Online Video; Tables none (Excel has no media). New: **Words** reads a film or sound
      embedded as an object (Word's Insert › Object › Create from file: an OLE package, `OfficeVideo.ole` reads its Ole10Native
      stream, mini stream too) — Word's EMF icon drawn as a dark frame with the play mark, a sound as the speaker, kind "Audio";
      a tap plays it in place. **Slides** plays a film or sound by its slide's timing (PowerPoint's mediacall, LibreOffice's
      media-call: Start Automatically / In Click Sequence), read, played in the show, written back when animations are changed;
      an Impress sound with no picture gets the speaker. **PDF** (PdfMedia.kt + a 2-line hook in PdfScreen, view mode only):
      Screen renditions, RichMedia assets, Movie files and Sound samples (made a WAV), with the play mark, a tap plays in
      place. **Fix** in `VideoFrame`: a second film tapped while a frame was open showed the first one / stayed silent; the
      same player now gets the new file. Fixtures: test/resources/media.py → media.pptx, media.docx, media.odp and
      androidTest/assets/media.pdf. Unit 662/0/12; PdfMediaDeviceTest on the tablet; tablet: the deck's film started by
      itself and its sound on the click, the .docx's film and both sounds, the PDF's film and sound all played (audio focus
      taken each time). Files kept: the media parts byte-identical after saving (tests). Merged into main 27 Oct (b2541542).
      Then (the user: "Words is correct do the same on PDF"; "I move the video and the page moves with it"; "Fix … oversights";
      "when I am inserting a PDF can I choose more than one?"): PDF Edit as Words — a tap chooses a film (framed), its Video
      (Audio) tab has Play, a tap elsewhere lets go, dragging moves it (one undo step, `PdfDoc.moveMedia`); a film or sound with
      no picture of its own drawn (dark frame, speaker); Slides reads PowerPoint's embedded-object films and sounds (p:oleObj
      Package) and LibreOffice's copy (draw:object-ole), Words LibreOffice's .odt copy of Word's; Insert PDF takes several, in
      the order chosen. Tablet: all seen. **Open:** a PDF film is moved but not resized; on a turned page it moves the page's way;
      `claude/pdf-like-words` needs these PdfScreen touches carried over (notes: office-media.md).
- [x] (setup-guide session, 26 Oct; merged into main in both repos) **(5b) the graphical guide**, in all 24 languages.
      Android Guide.kt: on first start (it replaced the photo screen; the photo question is a Permissions step) and
      Settings › Guide; chapters Welcome, Your computer (works alone; Local Sync › Scan a code), Permissions (9, each with
      its state and Allow; "not on this device" for calls on a SIM-less tablet), Home (6), Files (7), Settings (2), Icons
      (the catalog, the user's ask). Each step: a drawn copy of Tetra's own piece with the spot ringed, moving where it
      helps (a file flies when moved, a copy stays, Trash and back, a Home part carried to its cell — the user: "keep it
      as is, but … show what happens"); Try it docks the step under the real screen (beside it on a tablet). Desktop
      Guide.tsx: a panel beside the page, first time and Settings › Guide; Your devices (the first start's own Server /
      Client page, Add a device, the key), Files, Settings, Icons (one pencil: Edit or Rename, depending on where).
      660 Android / 159 desktop tests pass. Seen on the tablet 971f6b37 (Greek) except the last round (catalog, pencil,
      fixes after the walk-through) and the first-start path (not run: it needs empty app data); desktop seen from source.
      **Open:** Android's own "Allow all" / "While using the app" in 23 languages unchecked; no native readers.
- [x] (pdf-like-words session, 26–27 Oct; branch `claude/pdf-like-words`, merged into main 27 Oct with office-media) The PDF
      editor built like Words, tab by tab (the user: "take it on you"): what is on a page is a Words object, a PDF text is
      Words' paragraphs on Words' engine, Words' Home, top bar, Find and Replace, Insert, Draw, Design (new), Layout,
      Review (Words' comment cards), Selection and object tabs, the phone's keyboard bar, the ribbon at the top on a
      desktop; Pages' Duplicate, Split, Crop, Flatten; Protect's Remove hidden information. Done and left in
      PDF_LIKE_WORDS.md › State. 27 Oct morning: Add text, Crop, WordArt gallery, Links; on the tablet (its build installed
      there); found Undo-after-AutoSave does nothing (main too) — Undo now stops at the last save, PDF AutoSave 30 s +
      background + leaving. 665 unit + 18 PDF device tests pass; ribbon-at-top and phone size seen; phone not tried.
- [x] (merged into main 27 Oct, a0f5f421) **Merge `claude/pdf-save-fix` first** (from main, two commits; the second: Undo stops at the last save, as MuPDF
      cannot undo what a save wrote — main's Undo did nothing after AutoSave): every PDF save after the first in a session (AutoSave's)
      or on another day dropped what the saves before wrote — the file left with dangling objects. Found 27 Oct.
- [ ] (was the top of the list; the item as the user gave it) **TOP OF THE LIST — the PDF editor works exactly like Words** — **with the user, when they have time, watching each step; no agent starts it alone** (the user, 26 Oct, on the tablet: "I don't like how PDF
      does things. If we need to, we build our own stuff like we did with the rest of Office. Everything works completely
      differently from Words"). Screenshots, kept local and out of git: `user-screenshots/2026-10-26-pdf-vs-words/` — 1–3
      Words' Position (the page shown small, "Drag it into place", Done), 4 Words' text box chosen (thin outline, one round
      rotate handle above, small square handles, its own WordArt / Shape options / Size / Wrap / Position / Bring forward
      ribbon), 5 the PDF's text box today (thick double outline, oversized square handles, a different ribbon: Position ·
      arrows · Arrange · Rotate · Duplicate · Delete). Wanted: a PDF text box, picture and drawing **are** Words' objects —
      the same selection, handles, drag-to-move, resize, rotate, double-tap to type, the same Position page and the same
      ribbon tabs and items in the same places — by reusing Words' code (memory "Office: reuse Words": one engine, no second
      implementation), and building Tetra's own pieces where MuPDF's annotation model can't do it. The arrows-and-handles
      fix on claude/pdf-handles is superseded by this; don't merge it as the answer.
      **Not only these** (the user, 26 Oct: "it isn't only these, there are many, and I want them 1 to 1 wherever it makes
      sense"): go through Words' whole UI — every tab, ribbon item, strip, menu, dialog, gesture, selection and handle,
      text editing, fonts and styles, tables, pictures, shapes, drawing, comments, find/replace, zoom, view, file menu — and
      make the PDF editor match it one to one wherever it makes sense for a PDF; list each item as same / adapted / n/a.
      **Plus what only PDFs have**, in Words' style: rearranging pages (drag to reorder, rotate, delete, extract, insert
      blank or from another PDF, merge and split), page thumbnails, fill & sign, forms, redaction, protection, flatten,
      compress, export.
- [x] (translations session, 25–26 Oct; Drive-Android `claude/translations`, Drive `translations`; merged, nothing
      installed on the phone or tablet) **Translations, Greek first** (the user: "start the translation work; first
      translation Greek. Make the code translation flexible so we can add all the EU countries. And have a language option
      in the settings"). Android: 4,059 strings + 87 plurals in res/values/strings.xml, all in Greek in values-el (one
      section per applet); a new language is one file, res/values-<tag>/strings.xml — the build lists the folders
      (BuildConfig.LANGUAGES) and generates Android's locale config, so Settings › Appearance › Language and Android's own
      App languages page offer it. StringsTest fails if a language lacks a string or its placeholders differ. One commit per
      applet; code that compared shown English text (photo permission, Sync's "reach the computer", Calendar's Starts/Ends,
      Slides' text effects, Tables' "…" menus, Contacts' History…) now uses IDs. Not translated on purpose: file and folder
      names, style/font/function names, text written into documents (citations, captions, "Page 1" in headers), log lines.
      Desktop: locales/en.json + el.json (1,659 keys), t(), Settings › Language (system default), 151 tests pass. Checked in
      Greek on the tetra_shots emulator at phone and tablet size, and the desktop from source (hidden). 26 Oct (the user):
      Photos is Φωτοθήκη, Local Sync Συγχρονισμός on Home, Tables' new sheets Φύλλο1 and printed headers "Σελίδα 1 από 3".
      PDF too (26 Oct, after `claude/pdf-handles` was merged): 151 pdf_* strings; on a phone Words' and PDF's view-only bar
      shows Edit as the pencil alone, as Tables' and Slides' ("Επεξεργασία" left the file's name no room). Merged into main
      in both repos (the user, 26 Oct). Maps' voice now follows the app's language when "Directions in" was never set (it
      was always Greek).
- [x] (eu-languages session, 26 Oct, on main in both repos, not pushed, nothing installed) **The other 22 EU languages**
      (the user: "work on your own on the rest of the EU languages"): bg cs da de es et fi fr ga hr hu it lt lv mt nl pl pt
      (European) ro sk sl sv, each one values-<tag>/strings.xml and one desktop/locales/<tag>.json, translated from English
      by one agent a language with Microsoft Office's terms (Opus, finished by Haiku at the user's word; Irish and Maltese
      all Haiku). Folder paths on disk stay English. The desktop's Language is a list now; its test lets a plural's
      one-form keep {count} (Croatian's "one" is also 21, 31…). StringsTest, 151 desktop tests and the build pass. **Not
      checked on a screen** (no tablet connected): long words cut with "…" in German/Finnish/Hungarian. **Open for the
      user**: calls.askFirst says recording without consent is a crime "in Greece" in every language; Irish and Maltese
      want a native reader most; Hungarian's first desktop chunks say "PC", the rest "számítógép".
- [x] (data-calls session, 25 Oct; branches `claude/data-calls` / Drive `data-calls`, not merged, nothing installed) Three of the
      user's reports. **41 % on the phone, 40 % on the computer, 83 % on the tablet**: the computer's copy of the phone's October
      stayed at the 10:00 counts (120.9 GB) while every newer version arrived as a sync copy ("(2)", "(2) (3)"… 14 of them, mtime
      all 09:11:59.373), which nothing read and the cleanup deleted, the newest (20:00, 123.3 GB) among them. Now on both sides a
      device's month is the newest of the file and its copies (counted later, else further into the day), and the cleanup removes
      only older copies (the newest stays until its month catches up); each month's first line says when it was counted
      (`"counted"`, ms) and the computer's page says "<phone>'s counts from 20:14", re-reads each minute, and rounds the ring down
      as the phone does. The tablet: its own plan.json from its Setup at 09:30 (carrier offset +121 GB, rev 1 like the phone's), so
      neither won; now the highest rev, on a tie the plan by the device with mobile data, and the cleanup puts it in plan.json's
      place. The sync engine's part is Drive `sync-one-writer` (not merged). **Background**: the files did travel (the computer got
      a phone version about every two hours today, the tablet every quarter hour), nothing to change. **Calls**: a call ringing or
      dialled with the phone paired but not on the computer's Bluetooth: connected by itself ("Connecting <phone> by Bluetooth for
      the sound…"), else the bubble says "Sound stays on the phone: <phone> did not connect by Bluetooth" before Answer. DataTest 15,
      desktop 147 (calls.test.js new, a fake bluetoothctl); emulator: the stamp written, the phone's plan winning (a crash found
      there and fixed: a plan by a device with no counts); the computer's page from source on a copy of the real files: 123 GB, 40 %.
- [x] (github session, 25 Oct) **Tetra on GitHub** (the user: "make new cards … a nice landing page with a download
      button … the same for the desktop app … a GitHub page"). Before the push, the unpushed history of both repos
      (261 + 78 commits) was rewritten so no personal data goes public: the house's address and position, the village,
      the schools, a nephew's birthday, a name from Photos and a few real fixes became invented ones (in files and
      commit messages; the old history is only local, `refs/backup/pre-scrub-main-20261025`). Three Maps tests that
      drive on the user's own map data (and one desktop test) are skipped now; put real places back locally to run them.
      READMEs of both repos are landing pages with cards (Assets/cards, made on a fresh emulator `tetra_shots` and the
      desktop from source, all sample data invented), download buttons, the speed tables; docs/ is the Pages site.
      Releases: Android v0.6.0-beta.1 (release key), desktop desktop-v0.6.0-beta.21. LICENSE is now the GPL 3.0 or later
      (the user, 25 Oct: "Yes update the license"), which MuPDF's AGPL 3.0 can be combined with; the desktop was GPL 3.0 already.
- [x] (27 Oct) Notes: Export as Markdown (the user, 25 Oct: "add export as markdown"; 27 Oct: "… categorized by folders with
      the tags' names"): Export as Markdown in the Labels drawer (every note into a new Files/Tetra-Notes-export-<date>-<HHMM>,
      a folder per label, "/" nesting, archived in Archive/, trashed in Trash/) and in a note's sheet (phone/tablet) or bar (PC);
      front matter of tags and dates, file time = the note's; NoteExport in Notes.kt = markdown/markdownFiles in notes.js,
      same tests. Branches claude/notes-markdown and notes-markdown, not merged.
- [x] (25 Oct) **Small icons only** is Home's default (the user: "change the default home to small icons only"): a new
      install, a reset Home and a new applet start small; a saved layout stays as it is. Built with the sync fix (SYNC_PLAN 6ar)
      as Android 0.6.0-beta.2 (release key, versionCode 13) and desktop 0.6.0-beta.23; 658 Android and 148 desktop tests pass;
      installed on the tablet and the phone.
- [ ] Home edit: a part made smaller fills the empty cells by itself (the user, 25 Oct: "when you make them small you have
      to rearrange them after because they leave empty space; we could make it just auto fill empty spots"). Today a part
      keeps its cell when it shrinks, so groups made small leave rows of gaps until each icon is dragged up.
- [x] (contacts-lazy session, 25 Oct; merged 440a754 / Drive f5b008c) Contacts and
      the Phone open at once (the user: "slow, taps don't answer until it's all ready"). Read ahead when Tetra opens: the
      favourites and the first screenful first (their faces made small at once, ContactThumbs), then everyone; sorting,
      duplicates and photo decoding off the screen's thread; Recents read ahead and shown before the computer's call
      history is written. writer.log says each opening's times ("Contacts: opened …", "Calls: opened …"). On the phone:
      Contacts 290–380 ms → 180–230 ms (3.3 s → 0.19 s right after Tetra starts); Phone 380–405 → 180–230 ms (2.3–2.8 s →
      0.25 s). Favourites: a two-row grid on top of All, the last cell "+N" opens Favourites (phone and desktop); a heart
      for favourites everywhere, Contacts and the Phone (the star is the default number's). A contact's page ends with
      History (the last 50 calls on any of their numbers) and Recordings (Tetra/Phone/Recordings by name or number,
      ContactsRecordings), the latest three and See all on their own page, "No recordings so far"; call types a white
      arrow on green / blue / red (CallTypeIcon, desktop CallBadge) in Contacts and the Phone. Desktop 0.6.0-beta.14.
      Merged into main in both repos (25 Oct).
- [x] (813e7c4, 18c031f) Office: one tab row for Words, Slides and Tables; Settings › Tab marker: Bubble / Dash; the
      bubble in each app's colour (office tab-marker session, 17 Oct).
- [x] (386b04c) A: tab names and order alike in Words, Slides, Tables (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (4a6d7b1) A: the same File in all three; Slides gets Versions, Export PDF, Print, About, Send log (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (5e8b4e8) A: an icon on every action in Tables' and Slides' ribbons (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (66b4b5a) A: strips open alike, ‹ and a name in the ribbon's place (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (4ddb8da) A: one set of colours, one font button, one size stepper (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (c00f9ff) A: the top bar alike; Slides keeps a recovery draft (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (20e0b17) A: shortcuts alike — Slides' Ctrl+C/X/V, Tables' Delete (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (f65b50a) A: messages alike; Slides' ribbon no longer goes after Save on a tablet (office-parity builder, 17 Oct).
- [x] (1e0160a, be4d2e6, 7549d88, 100300f, 8c052fb) The Office engine, steps 0–4 (office-engine session, 17 Oct); step 5
      (the pure move to OfficeText.kt) left for a quiet moment; the tablet walk waits for the tablet.
- [x] The phone's own fonts (the user, 17 Oct: "draw a document's font with the phone's own when it has it, and add a
      Phone fonts group to the shared font picker"; "next to font a search bar would be nice") (office-engine session):
      `OfficeFonts` finds the phone's families by the name inside each font file (`familyName`, `covers`: the name and
      cmap tables) and uses one of a document's font's name before Word's twins and the guesses (pages and editor alike);
      the shared font strip (Words, Tables) lists "Phone fonts" after the document's and Word's — those with Latin
      letters of their own, ~45 on the tablet (Roboto, Noto Serif, MiSans, Dancing Script, Coming Soon…) — and has a
      "Search fonts" field beside its name (over the cards on a phone). Words' fingerprint unchanged on the emulator and
      the tablet; `OfficeFontsTest`; the user tried it on the tablet ("I used it it works"). Not done: a name typed that
      is not in the list cannot be used as a font (Word allows it); Slides gets the strip with B's Home.
- [x] (calendar session, 17–18 Oct) **Calendar**, Tetra's last app (§ Calendar below): steps 1–7 built, 18 Oct, on
      Drive-Android branch `calendar` (worktree Drive-Android-worktrees/calendar, from writer-library 6fdf06a: a308980,
      242c094, 4cc9368, 4c43b7a, 7584567) and Drive branch `calendar` (worktree Drive-worktrees/calendar, from
      bidirectional-sync 36a82bd: c2ab218, ea3e221). Checked on the emulator (tablet size and phone size) and the desktop
      hidden; **not pushed, not merged, not on the tablet yet** — step 8 waits for the user. Skill installed.
- [~] (office-engine session, 17 Oct) B top-down on the engine, then C, then A's walk (the user: "ok comit and continue to finish office").
      Done here: Home (0ce3c4d), Insert › Text box (17b9bfb), Drop cap strip + Raised (c9c4683); handing on (notes:
      office-engine-17oct.md in the group's notes folder). Tablet in use (Crunchyroll) 15:00: these three seen on the emulator only.
- [~] (office-B session, 17 Oct, from office-engine's hand-over) B on from Dropped drop cap: the rest of Insert, Arrange, Slide,
      Design, Draw, Review, View, File, Slide show, References; then C, then A's walk. Tablet: Crunchyroll in front 15:35 — emulator.
      Done here: Dropped (5bf71af), Chart (1617bd3), Link (6ae8501), Header & footer (9578abf), Symbol/Date/Line break/Equation
      (4e68384). Unit suite 415/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing (after 9578abf). Tablet still Crunchyroll at 16:22: all on the

      Slides' Selection tab, X²/X₂ and Aa, Table tab, a text box's Layout, Animation pane and painter, show taps while a video plays;
      then (21:00) the Selection pane and Picture styles / Transparency. Unit 435/0/7, sweep 349 + 29 none failing (20:56, after d782c1e).
      Handing on (notes: office-D-17oct.md in the group's folder): the leftovers next touch Words' shared dialogs and drawing.

- [x] (office-strips session, 18 Oct, the only writer in this checkout) A › Made the same: the user's rule for options (18 Oct) — on a
      tablet/phone no lists over the page: presets get their own strip at the bottom (‹ name, ✓ / ×, More… → a window); desktop as is.
      In order: Slides › Design › Slide size; Design's Themes/Colours/Fonts/Background/Gradient; then every other popup in the three apps.
      Done: (1) the shared strip — `OfficeStripFrame` round each ribbon, `officeStrip` opens one in the ribbon's place (ribbon slides
      down, strip up, ‹ name, × ✓, Back cancels), `RibbonMenu` (a menu on a desktop, a strip on a tablet/phone); Slides › Design › Slide
      size on it: Widescreen 16:9, 16:10, Standard 4:3, 3:2, 1:2 (tall), Custom… (cm window); p:sldSz with PowerPoint's type
      (screen16x10, 35mm, custom), Impress's page size; with other changes unsaved it asks "Save and go on" instead of refusing. Test
      `each slide size saved` (pptx + odp, LibreOffice both ways). Unit 503, 0 failing, 7 skipped. Emulator (1280×800): strip, ✓, Ensure
      fit, Save and go on, Custom….
      (2) Slides › Design on strips: Themes (cards, the one tapped shown on the slides, More… = the full panel), Background and
      Gradient (shown as tapped, ✓ one Undo step, × back); Colours/Fonts' gallery now slides the ribbon down as Words' does.
      (3) The sweep (the user, 18 Oct: "everything that was recreated is made in to a list … Check in all applets of office"); on a
      desktop (ribbon at the top) every one is the menu it was. Found and changed:
      · every colour row (`Swatches`: Words' Text colour, Highlight, Shading, Page colour, the table's; Tables' Text colour, Fill, Tab
        colour; Slides' Text colour, Highlight, Fill, Border) → its own strip, picked then ✓, **More…** = Word's colour table (black and
        Word's ten standard colours on top, each a fifth lighter a row down) — the user: "a more that opens a table with these basic
        colors at the top and gradually brighter ones as you go down like the real word has".
      · Words: Aa, Spacing, picture Align, Design › Paragraph spacing, Watermark, Layout › Columns, Breaks; **Line numbers** = cards on
        the pages' strip like Insert › Page numbers (shown on the page as tapped, OK/Cancel) — the user: "I want the way the UI looks in Insert".
      · Slides: several chosen › Align, Aa, Spacing, Text effects, Arrange › Align, Text direction, Picture styles, Transparency, File ›
        Print, View › Zoom, References › Style; New slide / Layout and Table sizes strips now start with "‹ name".
      · Tables: Clear, Insert/Delete cells, Unhide sheet, Page layout's Orientation/Size/Margins/Scale/Header/Footer (Custom… opens its
        window), Formulas › Recently used, Home › Orientation.
      · Insert › Video (Words and Slides).
      Strips: presets picked then ✓ (× / ‹ / Back leave them); actions (Clear all, Shift cells down, Align left, Print…) act at the tap and
      the ribbon comes back. A phone: the name, × and ✓ on the tab row's line, the choices under them.
      Left as they are, deliberately: lists inside windows (Sort's column pickers), the top bar's ⋯ menu, right-click menus (see the next
      line), the tab-defining galleries shown in the ribbon itself as Word/PowerPoint do (Words' styles, table looks; Slides' transitions).
      Unit 503, 0 failing, 7 skipped. Emulator (tablet 1280×800 and phone 360 dp, ribbon at the bottom and at the top): Slide size,
      Themes, Background, Colours, Insert › Video, Words' Text colour + More…, Line numbers, Watermark, Spacing; Tables' Fill, Clear.
      Seen there: the emulator's Gboard (hardware-keyboard mode) floats its toolbar 28 dp above the room it tells apps it takes, over
      the ribbon; it can be dragged away (Gboard's own, not Tetra's).
- [x] (office-strips session, 18 Oct, carried on) The tablet walk's 22 findings (A › "The tablet walk, 18 Oct"): 1–14, 16–22 fixed, 15
      kept as the file has it (written there why); Tables › Selection › Select cells (the user's ask). Commits 9ea0280 … 77fbc42. Unit 505,
      0 failing, 7 skipped. All on emulator-5554 (tablet 1280×800; the phone size for the strips); the tablet was not touched.
- [ ] (the user, 18 Oct: "right click otions go in the selection tab in phone and tablet") Words, Slides, Tables: what a right-click
      menu offers is on the Selection tab on a phone and tablet (the ribbon at the bottom); the menu stays for a mouse.
- [x] (office-strips session, 18 Oct, after 0.5.0 Beta 2 — merged main's 02edcee) The user: "the resents does not update in office when
      I open a file from picker or Files. In tablet and bigger screens add a heart at the top to go strait to favorites. In phone it does not
      feet place it in the file tab. Do it for all a applets".
      (1) Recents: every file opened in Words, Tables, Slides or PDF — the home's list, the picker, another app, Files — goes on a list of
      its own (`OfficeRecents`); the home lists those first, then the newest of each kind, and reads both again when it shows (a resume,
      a file opened). Emulator: from another app and from Files, back to the home: the file on top. (054bd38)
      (2) The open file's heart, one shared piece (`rememberOfficeFavourite`, Files' favourites as the home's hearts): 600 dp and wider in
      the top bar of Words, Tables, Slides and PDF, filled when it is one; a phone in the File tab ("Add to favourites" / "Remove …"),
      the PDF viewer's ⋯. Emulator: arrange.pptx's heart → in the home's Favourites; Words' favourite filled; the phone's File tab.
      Unit 507, 0 failing, 7 skipped. Not done: a file that is not in Tetra's Files (a PDF opened from another app is read from a copy in
      the app's cache) has no heart. Seen: opening a file of Tetra's own Documents from another app makes a copy in "From other apps"
      each time ("Reading list (9).docx") — [x] open the file itself when it is already in Tetra's Files.
- [x] (open-in-place session, 18 Oct) A Tetra file opened from the picker or another app opens itself, not a copy in "From other
      apps" (the line above's last [ ]): `OfficeOpen` now also resolves content://media/… (MediaStore's own address, what other apps'
      Open with gives) and Tetra's own share address (content://com.kalotrapezis.drive.files/tetra/…) to the file; the picker's
      Files/Documents roots already did. Files outside the phone's storage are copied as before. Emulator: Reading list.docx and
      Ferry and rooms.pdf by content://media, the own address, the PDF picker (Tetra/Documents) and Words' picker (Documents root) —
      each opened in place with its heart, no new copy. Unit 508, 0 failing, 7 skipped. Not tried: a save after such an open (it is
      the same file object Files opens).
- [x] (timer session, 18 Oct) **Timer**, Android and desktop, branches `timer` in both repos (from `calendar`): § Timer below. Also
      the Calendar's and the Timer's folders hidden in Files on both. Not merged, not on the tablet.
- [x] (notes-audit session, 19 Oct) The Codex bug-audit patch
      (backups/2026-10-19-codex-worktrees/bug-audit-uncommitted.patch) against main: none of it was there, all its tests failed.
      Applied: Notes — one lock per notes folder for every NotesStore, a deleted note's id never read/listed/written again and a
      stale file of it deleted at sync, a failed save or ledger write throws instead of deleting, updatedAt always moves forward
      (a corrupt deletions.json still reads as empty, not a crash). Files — Copy and Empty trash refuse a folder holding a link
      (on main Empty trash deleted what an escaping link pointed at). NotesTest +6, DriveFilesTest +2; unit 547, 0 failing, 8 skipped.
- [-] (the user, 20 Oct: "no map scrap it the app will get 2GB") **Maps** (§ Maps below): dropped; worktree and branch `maps` removed.
- [~] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) **Maps restarted** (the user, 21 Oct: "I changed my mind start buidlding the map applet";
      "we may transfer this map to the desktop as well"): branch `maps`, worktree Drive-Android-worktrees/maps; step 1's
      files downloaded to ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Data by tools/maps-greece.sh (§ Maps below): greece.pmtiles 485 MB (Protomaps
      20261021, zoom 0–15, Geofabrik's Greece border) and greece-latest.osm.pbf 327 MB (md5 checked), ~3 min.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Timer: its waste files cleared (the user, 21 Oct: "some kind of a garbige collector be cause
      the timer app creates a lot of duplicat files what is nessesary and what is waste … on the phone I dont know about the
      desktop"): 23 of the 28 files on the PC and the tablet were sync's "<id> (n).json" copies from the 18 Oct bug (fixed
      since: one file per device). TimerFiles.clean / desktop timer.js clean, the same rule: every copy goes, the timer kept
      as it is (its newest state, pin and all, written into the device's own file first when only a copy held it). Runs
      when the Timer opens (phone) and when desktop Tetra starts. Sync never deletes, so the copies stop coming back only
      once every device has the new version (phone, tablet, PC .deb). Dry run on a copy of the PC's folder: 23 removed,
      the five timers unchanged. Tests: TimerTest, desktop test/timer.test.js.
- (the user, 22 Oct) **Desktop Tetra's scope**: no PDF editor, no Office, no Text editor on the desktop — "Office things that I
      can just throw in to files no reson to rebuild what is there" (they open in the PC's own programs). Maps does come to the
      desktop, because it syncs the same way the Timer does. Desktop Timer's copy-cleaner (d7fec05) is not in the installed
      0.6.0-beta.1 (built 19 Oct): a new .deb is needed; the PC's Timer folder still holds 25 old copies.
- [x] (22 Oct night, the user: "bring the destop up to speed with the android versions. No office or Text Edittor just the maps
      and the changes in the galery") Desktop 0.6.0-beta.3 (Drive 141d40e, aac3c9b, 36c1dd1): Photos' Text in the photo (a panel
      beside Details, select part to copy), Hide eyes and Hide text (the editor's Hide mode, bar or stars) — the phone's
      tessdata_fast models through tesseract.js, eyes from YuNet; and Maps (§ Maps). Checked in the packaged app (text, eyes,
      a route). The .deb is built, not installed (the user installs it: sudo dpkg -i …0.6.0-beta.3_amd64.deb).
- Other sessions: add your line here when you start.
- [x] (phone session, 24 Oct; branches `phone` in Drive-Android (worktree Drive-Android-worktrees/phone, from main bc485fb) and
      Drive (worktree Drive-worktrees/phone, from main bfc589c); **merged into main in both repos 24 Oct at the user's word ("comit
      murge"; fast-forward to fdcd703 / Drive 4ce779d), branches and worktrees removed; not on the phone yet**) **Phone**, § Phone steps 1–9 (the
      user: "ok make a phone branch"; "No dont stop for every step use the emulator"; "use an island for recents, favorites and
      contacts, recordings, everything centered … see the apps UI UX follow along"). Each step checked on the emulator
      (emulator-5556, tetra_check; fake calls with `adb emu gsm`), the desktop pages rendered off-screen; see § Phone › Steps for
      what each did and what only the real phone, tablet and computer can show. Answers taken from the plan's recommendations
      until the user says otherwise (colour the icon's teal; two taps on pickup, none at the end; Home: favourites to call;
      recording on the PC after "They agreed").
- [x] (phone-plan session, 24 Oct, branch claude/phone-plan; not merged) § Phone planned: the dialer applet, vibration on
      pickup, call recording (not on the phone; possible on the PC), Play's call-log rule. Waits for the user's answers.
- [x] (contacts-build session, 24 Oct, from main; branches claude/contacts-583397 and Drive contacts) Calls on the computer
      (the user: "a bubble with the face and name, answer or end"; "how do I know they are connected by Bluetooth?"): the
      phone reports its calls (ringing + number, active, ended) to the computer; the desktop's call bubble (always on
      top) with face, name, number, state and time, End call / Decline · Answer, done by the phone (ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS;
      asked once in Settings › Contacts with the reason). Sound: on the phone, or on the PC when the phone is paired by
      the system's Bluetooth and connected as a hands-free kit (the PC offers HFP "Handsfree"; WirePlumber 0.5) —
      desktop Settings › Calls shows it, Connect, Open Bluetooth settings; a notification on connect/drop. Hold: not
      possible (only the phone app). Tried with a real call on the Xiaomi 15 over Bluetooth: the other side heard
      their voice twice (the PC's mic picks up its speakers) → PipeWire's webrtc echo canceller loaded for the call's
      length (calls.js `echo`; Drive bfc589c, 0.6.0-beta.13). The user: done; come back if more problems.
- [x] (contacts-build session, 24 Oct, from main c16ca05 / Drive f83bdcf; branches claude/contacts-583397 and Drive contacts)
      Contacts in a narrow window (the user): one column as the phone's — the list, then a contact over it with ‹ — on the
      desktop and on Android when the window narrows (split screen, a folded tablet; seen on the emulator resized
      1280→560 dp); the first contact opens by itself only in two columns. Phone: contacts read ahead when Tetra opens
      (ContactsPreload) and a spinner until the first read, never "No contacts" while loading. Not yet on the phone.
- [x] (contacts-build session, 24 Oct; branches claude/contacts-583397 and Drive contacts, not merged) Contacts after the
      user's look at the desktop: read ahead and a spinner (not "No contacts yet" while loading); the contact's island in
      the middle with Call · Mail · WhatsApp · Viber, ♥ and Edit in an island beside it, icons on the cards; From Photos
      (Photos' people and faces, a "Person 12" takes the contact's name) and Faces from Photos for many; Call = the paired
      phone places it (SyncServer /call: at once with CALL_PHONE, else a notification to tap; Settings › Contacts asks once,
      for Tetra, not per contact). Phone: Share · ☆ · Edit in one island at the bottom right, the first number under each
      name in the list (the user). Phone: Edit at the bottom
      right (the user). Desktop 0.6.0-beta.7 .deb built, not installed; the phone build not installed (the user: not yet),
      so a call from the PC is not tried on the real pair.
- [x] (contacts-build session, 23 Oct; merged into main in both repos at the user's word, with the thumbnails work committed first; desktop 0.6.0-beta.6 .deb built from Drive main, not installed) **Contacts** on Android, § Contacts steps 1–8
      (step 9 later). Then the sync and the desktop (the user, 23 Oct: "now do the desktop and the sync"): main merged
      into the branch; scope `contacts` (SYNC_PLAN 6ap) — on the real pair a PC-made contact reached the phone in 7 s with
      its birthday's event, a star on the phone the PC in 4 s, a delete on the PC the phone's Trash in 6 s; desktop Contacts
      (Drive branch `contacts`, Drive-worktrees/contacts: contacts.js + Contacts.tsx, 0.6.0-beta.6 .deb built, not installed). On the phone (main + the branch, 22:32): 318 of its
      contacts imported (71 photos, 14 birthdays into Γενέθλια), WhatsApp/Viber chips and Message strip seen. Waiting on the
      user there: Link birthdays (2 suggested — "Ελπίδα (Όνομα)" may be a name day), Merge & fix (12), Allow for History and
      In the phone's contacts. Tablet not connected: seen on the tablet emulator only.
- [x] (send-to-computer session, 23 Oct; branch claude/keen-grothendieck-9e0fad, Drive branch send-to-computer in
      Drive-worktrees/send-to-computer) (the user, 23 Oct: "with Bluetooth, could Files be in the sharing menu so you send
      files to the PC at once?") **Send to computer** in Android's share menu, over sync's Wi-Fi link (not Bluetooth), into
      the PC's ~/Tetra/Files/From phone (the user's choice); offline → a private outbox, sent when the computer is seen
      (JobScheduler retry, any sync, its "sync now"). The other way too (the user: "Yes, both ways"): desktop Files'
      Send to phone and the tray's "Send files to phone…", into the phone's Tetra/From computer. Both folders are in Files,
      so sync then carries them to the other side as well (accepted with the choice).
      Built and tried on the real pair (Drive SYNC_PLAN 6ao): photo + PDF on the PC in ~1.2 s, SHA-256 equal; with the PC's
      Tetra stopped the PDF waited and landed when it came back; two files to the phone in 0.7 s; each side's notification
      opens Files at the folder. The user's own try found a crash (a long Greek PDF name past 255 bytes) — fixed and re-run.
      Merged into main in both repos (the user, 23 Oct: "Merge both branches into main and build the new desktop .deb"):
      desktop 0.6.0-beta.5. Not done: sharing text or a link (no file) says "Nothing to send".
- [x] (f5c3277, 23 Oct) Android Auto in the user's car: stuck on "Finding the way…" — the car refused navigationStarted and
      the HostException crashed Tetra; now logged and the route driven anyway. Android Auto lists a sideloaded Car App
      Library app in a real car only after a desktop head unit run (Unknown sources doesn't cover it, Google's docs); every
      new install drops it until the DHU is run again. So the phone is installed with tools/phone-install.sh: install, wait for
      the user's Start head unit server, the DHU until Android Auto's check passes Tetra, then closed (~15 s).
- [x] (0428e49, df4b2f0, 2170623, 23 Oct) Maps by car after the user's drive: a new route keeps the car's heading; turns
      warned a street early / 150 m+; sharp-bend warnings (setting); the car's recenter button; a busy crossing's picture in
      the turn card and the map close and flat near it (Νικήσιανη, Δράμα's 5 Δρόμοι); lane guidance from OSM's turn:lanes
      (tools/maps-lanes.py → greece-lanes.tsv in Tetra/Maps): a lane strip, "από τη δεξιά λωρίδα", "Συνεχίστε ευθεία" for a
      keep along the through lanes; exits warned at 3 km and "take the exit" where its lane begins. Not yet driven.
- [x] (a9d9756, 23 Oct) Maps drive traces (files/logs/drive, 7 days, Settings › Maps › Send log), richer navigation log
      lines, MapsGuide.guide shared by car, phone and MapsReplayTest (traces in ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Data/traces are replayed).
- [x] (fd304b1, 66bdce9, 6ad773a, 23 Oct) Android Auto tried with the user on the head unit: the first route no longer
      waits 22 s for the search list (tolls from their own lines); camera by speed and what is ahead (carView), car low on
      the screen; crossing square under ⚙ / in the corner; cards at the edges, bottom card icons in one row; bigger arrow;
      recenter checked (drag → let go, ◎ → back). Not yet driven.
- [x] (calendar-sync fix, 23 Oct; Drive 77b9d08) The user's ~/Tetra/TETRA_BUG_calendar.md: rm'd events came back, identical "(2)" copies,
      a birthday changed. Fixed in both repos (Drive SYNC_PLAN 6an): a path removed here is not asked back, Calendar events
      follow into the other side's Trash, the same bytes never land as "(2)", SEQUENCE first between two versions. The
      birthday: the phone's two changed copies read 23 Oct — 16:53:21Z an editor save in Γενέθλια (VALARM rewritten as
      -PT15H "Reminder", SEQUENCE 1), 16:53:27Z Delete › This event on 27 Jun 2027 in Personal (EXDATE, SEQUENCE 1);
      both moved into the phone's Trash. Desktop 0.6.0-beta.4 installed; Personal cleaned (387, no copies); phone and
      computer Calendar byte for byte the same (468 files). Tablet not yet synced (hotspot isolates it); APKs not installed.
- [x] (contacts-plan session, 23 Oct) **Contacts** planned, not built (§ Contacts below): research, files, sync, birthdays,
      photos from Photos' faces, UI, Home, icons, integrations. Nine questions at its end wait for the user's answers.
- [x] (fef0be0, Drive ebad077; maps-slots session, 23 Oct) Maps from the user: saving into an empty Home slot did nothing
      (the phone); slot 7 a supermarket on the tablet, home on the PC. Found: the phone held home in three files (fe7a06.json,
      (2), (3)) from syncs that saw it changed on both sides, the phone's own save stamped with an older copy's date, so a
      copy won. Now one file a place (older copies to Tetra/Trash on read; a save trashes its other copies; delete trashes),
      and two places in one slot both stay — the newest keeps it, the other the first free slot (settle), the same on phone
      and desktop. The tablet: My Market (slot 6), Joy, Πάρκινγκ Αμεα never reached the PC (not marked deleted) and it has no
      home — it has not synced since 22 Oct (hotspot). Notes: maps-slots-23oct.md. On the phone (36a602e, 22:01):
      home is one file, slot 7, its two other copies in its Trash — as the PC (newest fe7a06.json, slot 7). **Not on the
      tablet** (not connected); the desktop's fix comes with 0.6.0-beta.5 (Drive aa87cc4), not installed at 22:05.
- [x] (file-thumbnails session, 23 Oct; committed on main by the contacts-build session at the user's word) **Thumbnails in Files**, phone/tablet and desktop (the user: "thumbnails in Files in the
      desktop and phone … the blue lines for Words files, the green table for the Tables files, the play button thing for
      Slides"): pictures and videos their own; Words/Tables/Slides/PDF their first page with Office's glyph in the centre; cached
      outside Tetra's folder. Files touched: Android FileThumbs.kt (new) + MainActivity's DriveRowItem/DriveGridItem; Drive
      desktop thumbs.js (new), main.js's media:// handler, files.js's item (thumb), src/Files.tsx, src/Icon.tsx, styles.css.
      Built: phone draws a document's first page with its own Words (OfficePages), Tables (SheetPainter) and Slides
      (Slides.draw), pictures/videos by ThumbnailUtils, PDF by PdfRenderer; cache in the app's cacheDir/file-thumbs. Desktop:
      sharp, ffmpeg, pdftoppm, and LibreOffice headless (one at a time, ~0.8 s a document) into DATA_DIR/file-thumbs. Both
      name a thumbnail by path|size|mtime (a changed file gets a new one), mark undrawable ones .none, keep the newest 4000.
      Glyphs: the Office home's ic_file_text / ic_table / ic_play in Word blue, Excel green, PowerPoint orange.
      Checked: FileThumbsTest 3/3; desktop npm test 125/0 (thumbs.test.js 4); desktop seen in list and grid (hidden QA
      copy, scripts/shot.js, scratch folder). **Not seen on a device**: the emulator was in the contacts session's use and
      the tablet/phone wait for the user's OK.
- [x] (2bbd907, Drive b50a1d5; file-thumbnails session, 24 Oct; merged into main in both repos at the user's word)
      **File-type icons** (the user: "icons for file types … so the user can see at a glance what file it is, on phone or
      desktop. The Office ones you can also use in buttons"): the user's tiles (Assets/Archives, docs-txt, docs-word, excel,
      slides, bash-scripts, ebooks, html-pages, programs-executables) made 256 px by tools/file-icons.py (one rounded corner
      for all) into drawable-nodpi/kind_*.png and the desktop's public/kinds/; one table, app/src/main/resources/file-kinds.json
      (FileKinds.kt; the desktop copies it in scripts/copy-skill.js). Files' list and grid show them where a file has no
      thumbnail; Words/Tables/Slides thumbnails carry the tile as their badge instead of the glyph; Home's Open Words /
      Tables / Slides show the tiles (PDFs keeps its red icon). Before/after shown to the user. Emulator and desktop
      (hidden QA copy) checked; the user said merge. Not yet on the tablet or phone.
      Files2.png (the user: "Replace the first one on the phone"): the phone's Files icon now — Home's card, Settings ›
      App icons (tools/applet-icons.py from it as Files.png; applet_files #177BFC); the desktop keeps its own.
- [x] (f69bad4, Drive f17a77c; file-thumbnails session, 24 Oct; merged at the user's word) The user's PDF tile (Assets/pdf.png):
      "pdf" in file-kinds.json — its icon where it has no preview, and Home's Open PDFs. Then (the user: "When we have a
      preview of the file have no icon"): no badge over any preview, phone or desktop. The user's video and music tiles
      (Assets/video.png, music.png) as two more categories, and their new Office tile (Assets/Office.png, square like
      the others) as Home's Office card and its launcher icon (tools/applet-icons.py now takes Office.png). Their picture
      tile (Assets/images.png) where a picture's preview cannot be made. Then (the user: "dont show preview on office files
      at all" … "PDFs as well. lets keep documents icon only"): only pictures and videos have a preview; every document
      shows its tile — Words/Tables/Slides page drawing, the PDF renderer and the desktop's LibreOffice step removed.
      Checked on the tablet (the user: "you use the tablet an other session uses the emulator") and the desktop.
- [x] (maps-icon session, 23 Oct, branch claude/nifty-bouman-6f4a52) Maps' icon: the user's own (Assets/Icons/Applets/Maps.png,
      the same file as on claude/contacts-583397) made by tools/applet-icons.py into maps_art.png (Home's card) and
      applet_maps_fg.png (Settings › App icons and Android Auto, both @mipmap/applet_maps) — byte-identical to the contacts
      branch's, so only the script's lists and applet_colors.xml meet in that merge. Maps' colour is the icon's light blue
      #25C4FE (Category.Maps, applet_maps; maps_colors.xml, maps_art.xml, maps_launcher_fg.xml gone); the slots' tint light
      blue too. Inside Maps the indigo accents (buttons, markers, the car's tint; desktop Maps.tsx MAPS_COLOR) stay indigo (the user, 23 Oct);
      the desktop has no Maps applet icon or colour. Checked on the emulator, light and dark. Merged into main 23 Oct after
      Contacts, which had brought the same icon: main kept Contacts' Maps group (four slots, its tint); only the Timer icon was new.
      On the phone 23:13 (tools/phone-install.sh; Android Auto approved Tetra Maps again); not on the tablet.
- [x] (maps-icon session, 23 Oct, same branch) Timer's icon: the user's own (their ~/Tetra/Files/Timer.png of 18 Oct, copied to
      Assets/Icons/Applets/Timer.png, the original then moved to Tetra/Files/Trash as the user asked) made the same way into
      timer_art.png and applet_timer_fg.png; the launcher background its own edge turquoise #04D5CC (applet_colors.xml;
      timer_colors.xml, timer_art.xml, timer_launcher_fg.xml gone). Home's Timer teal (#00796B) kept: the same family as the
      icon. The desktop has no Timer applet icon. Checked on the emulator, light and dark.
- [x] (home-edit session, 24 Oct, branch claude/home-edit; not merged) **Home: edit, hide, resize — a launcher's grid** (the user:
      "Home page edit, hide, resize — like a launcher"; then "a grid that expands, to drag and drop where I want them"): Home is a
      grid of cells, 8 across on a tablet and 4 on a phone, growing down as far as the parts go. Hold any part (no need for edit
      mode) and drag it to any cell; gaps are allowed, parts in the way move on to the next free cells; the page scrolls at the
      top/bottom edge. A part is Large (its group as before: half a tablet / a phone's width, two rows; Sync and Settings one row)
      or Small (just its icon, one cell; Scanner & Codes two). The pencil (or the hold) shows each part's ⤢ (resize) and eye
      (hide) and the empty cells; hidden parts wait in a tray under the grid (tap to put back) and in Settings › Home (Open / Show
      on Home). Answers (24 Oct): hidden is only hidden — reminders, timers, sync go on; Local Sync and Settings move too
      (Settings can't be hidden); nothing on the desktop. Saved per device in SharedPreferences "home" (grid8 / grid4, HomeLayout.kt),
      not synced; Reset gives today's Home back. The user's Sync.png and Settings.png (~/Tetra/Files, 24 Oct) → Assets/Icons/Applets
      → sync_art/settings_art, on both cards and icons. Checked: HomeLayoutTest 6/6; emulator at tablet size (light) and phone size
      (dark): resize, hold-drag (in and out of edit mode; a hold opens nothing, a tap still opens), push aside, edge scroll, hide and
      the tray. **Not on the tablet or the phone yet** (tablet not connected; waits for the user's OK).
- [x] (home-edit session, 24 Oct, branch claude/home-medium; not merged) **Home: a Medium size** (the user: "add a medium size —
      just the icon, but make it take 4 cells"): Small (icon, 1 cell) · Medium (the icon alone, big, a 2×2 block; Scanner & Codes
      4×2) · Large (the group). ⤢ goes Large → Medium → Small → Large; saved as flag m. Edit mode draws only the empty cells.
      HomeLayoutTest 7/7; emulator tablet size (light) and phone size (dark). Not on the tablet (no OK at 24 Oct 08:55).
- [~] (maps-slots session, 24 Oct; branches claude/maps-narrow + Drive maps-narrow) Maps in a narrow window (the user: "one
      column … like the phone"). Desktop 78cd61f, a819b87: under 760 px the panel is a bottom sheet (45%, scrolls), the
      map's buttons at the top — seen in Tetra run from the branch at 1400, 700 and 520 px. Android: Maps is already one
      column at any width (the panel over the map, 560 dp at most; the window's own width, so split screen counts) —
      to see on the tablet in split screen. Not merged.
- [x] (maps-icon session, 24 Oct, branch claude/nifty-bouman-6f4a52) Notes' icon: the user's new Assets/Notes.png (the yellow
      rounded tile now in the picture: "in some places it had the yellow roundness and in some places it did not") made by
      tools/applet-icons.py like the others into notes_art.png and applet_notes_fg.png; Notes lost its special case there (Home's
      yellow behind a bare page, drawn smaller), so the launcher background is the tile's own edge yellow #FED00A and the
      tile sits as large as the others'; Home's card draws it at 76 dp as the others (it was 100 for the bare page). Home's
      Notes yellow (#F2B705) kept. Desktop: no Notes applet icon (public/notes.png is unused). Checked on the emulator, light,
      dark and Edit Home. Not merged until the user says.
- [x] (settings-redesign session, 24 Oct, branch claude/bold-nash-ef4aa6; not merged) **Settings re-arranged** (the user:
      "re-arrange it, modernise it … it does not separate a setting from text … The General category I think can go away"):
      SettingsScreen.kt. A list of categories (Tetra: Sync, Appearance · Apps: Gallery … Phone), each its own page — tablet
      (≥700 dp): list left 380 dp, page right; phone: one at a time, Back returns to the list. Contacts' island pills at the
      top (back + "Search settings", which finds a setting by its title and opens its page). In a page: quiet section headers,
      one row per setting (title, a line, the control at the end: switch, value ▾ menu, button or ›), the long explanations
      under their section. One accent (the theme's own black/white); an applet's colour only on its icon in the list.
      Same keys, defaults and actions; Choices' button rows became ▾ menus, Contacts' Turn on/off a switch, Calendar's
      messages toasts. **Before → after** (there was no "General" card: the uncoloured Storage locations, Permissions,
      Home, App icons and Appearance cards read as one, and are spread out):
      Storage locations → Files › Storage · Permissions: Photos → Gallery › Access, Files → Files › Access ·
      Gallery: Photo on Home → Appearance › Home; Search quality → Gallery › Search; Folders → Gallery › Folders ·
      Sync → Sync › Computer (paired, Forget, Open Sync) and › Automatic (Sync automatically, Listen in the background) ·
      PDF scanner → PDF scanner › Saved pages · Office → Office › Open from Files (4), › Editing (AutoSave, Lengths in, Read

      Import from Google Maps), › Installed maps, › Problems (Send log) · Contacts: Calls on the computer → **Phone › With the
      computer**; In the phone's contacts and Birthdays go into stay in Contacts · Phone → › Phone app, › Calls ·
      App icons → Appearance › App icons · Home (hidden parts) → Appearance › Home · Appearance (Theme) → Appearance.
      PhoneSettings (the Phone's own menu) and Office's File › Settings dialog unchanged. Checked on a read-only emulator of
      my own (tetra_check, port 5580): phone size light/dark, tablet size (2560×1600) light/dark, every page opened, search.
      **Not on the tablet yet** (not connected; the user's OK first). Not done: search knows titles only ("dark" finds nothing).
- [~] (maps-slots session, 24 Oct; branches claude/maps-main-roads + Drive maps-main-roads) Maps: Main roads or Shortest by car
      (the user, after the drive to the supermarket: "it always chooses the shorter path … even if that means a road that falls
      off a cliff"). The phone's 13:24 route to Σκάλα's school ran 2 km on a track, the car's to My Market 3.6 km on tertiary:
      car.json counts each km as 1.5 min more (distance_influence 90), so the shorter small road won. Main roads: no pull to
      the shorter way, smaller roads slower (tertiary 0.8 … track 0.1), searched without the shortcuts up to 500 000 nodes
      (~160 km; farther, the shortest way), phone, Android Auto (⚙ › Roads) and desktop (beside Car). MapsMainRoadsTest:
      Σκάλα 11.7 km/17 min no track, My Market 11.1 km on secondary. Road surface and slope are not in the graph (a rebuild
      would add them). Default Main roads (the user: yes). On the phone 24 Oct (phone-install.sh, Android Auto re-approved); not merged.
- [x] (data-plan session, 25 Oct, branch claude/data-plan; Drive branch `data`) **Data** planned and built, steps 2–8 (§ Data); not merged; on the phone, the tablet and the computer (details in § Data). Planned: Setup, usage and the plan (fair use, roaming
      day pass), live speed, three devices and the hotspot, Wi-Fi meter with Spots, signal drops; other apps checked; the house
      map explained, not built; battery set aside by the user; the user answered most questions 25 Oct.
- [x] (optimise session, 25 Oct; merged into main 4e669ea; on the phone) **Every applet opens fast** (the user, 25 Oct: "optimise all
      the rest of the apps. Notes needs optimisation; it's kind of slow to show the notes"), one by one with Contacts' recipe.
      Each applet writes its opening to writer.log ("Notes: opened → first notes … ms", ScreenTiming/OpenTiming). Measured on
      the tablet (971f6b37, debug build; the phone not connected): first content shown when tapped on Home, Tetra ready /
      reopened / tapped at once after start. Photos on the phone and the desktop (the tablet has no photos).

      **Result so far (25 Oct, 15:10):** every applet measured; Notes, Home, Files, Calendar, Timer, Data and Office's home
      changed, each a commit (the table below: before → after and what was slow). What was done, the same few things over:
      nothing read or worked out on the UI thread while a screen composes (dates, colours, tags, pictures, a database line);
      the list shown first and the side work after it (a Trash sweep, today's data counts, a service check, a clean-up); a
      read-ahead when Tetra starts, at a background priority; a small index in the app's cache so a restart does not read
      every file again (Notes' cards, the Calendar's events, the Office home's last look) — only files whose size or time
      changed are read again, whoever changed them (Tetra, sync, Claude's skills); one look at each file (its size and time
      in one call); made for thousands of items (the user: "think ahead"): the lists keep what a card shows, the whole item
      is read when opened, search indexes live only while searching, and what was deleted leaves memory (Tetra left open
      for months does not grow). Measured and left as they are (already quick, the camera or the map is the wait): Scanner
      341 / 142 / 397 ms, Codes 310 / 99 / 388, Text editor 200 / 116 / 224, Maps 376 / 246 / 364. Office and PDF
      documents measured (below; left as they are). Photos measured on the phone (below). Unit suite 655, 0 failing.

      **On the phone (Xiaomi 15, 208c8192, debug build; installed with tools/phone-install.sh, 25 Oct 15:20–15:50)** — first
      content in ms, Tetra ready; tapped at once after start; "taps" where the UI thread stayed busy after it:

      | Applet | before | after |
      |---|---|---|
      | Data | 2353–2426; at once 4917 and over 5 s | 425–555; 758–912 — the last counts at once, today's from Android ~2 s later, the ring, numbers and bars growing to them (the user's idea) |
      | Notes | 348–407; 399–496 | 134–169; 184–245 |
      | Calendar | 268–291; 340–391 | 155–246; 224–442 |
      | Photos (taps answered) | 341–394, taps from 693–1895; 619–667 | 411–462, taps from 113–130; 513–680 — the photo database's ten queries off the UI thread; the timeline waits for them so nothing hidden shows |
      | Office home | 711–881; 1060–1121 | 726–1174; 647–874 (the phone walks the library fast; the gain is the tablet's and a larger library's) |
      | Timer | 226–246; 242–257 | 168–226; 251–314 |
      | Files | 159–173; 219–250 | 151–228; 211–298 |
      | Contacts (taps, at once) | 157–218; taps from ~0.2 s | 176–250; taps from ~0.2 s |
      | Home's first frame | 519–586 | 506–584 |

      Found on the phone and fixed (6b12e1d): the Calendar's and Notes' read-aheads started with Tetra slowed Home's first frame
      (683–781 ms) and Home's Contacts and Phone groups reading through Contacts' read-ahead published its list again to an open
      Contacts (taps waiting ~1.3 s); now the read-aheads start after Home's first frame and Home reads the files itself.

      **The biggest lever is the build, not the code:** the phone and the tablet run a debuggable build, and Android runs a
      debuggable app's Compose several times slower. The same code built not debuggable, signed with the same debug key
      (so it installs over the app as it is, nothing lost), on the tablet the same hour:

      | Applet (Tetra ready; tapped at once after start) | debuggable | not debuggable |
      |---|---|---|
      | Notes | 435–438; 812 ms | 90–219; 112 ms |
      | Calendar | 781–784; 1324 ms | 111–112; 131 ms |
      | Data | 911–957 ms | 183–192; 327 ms |
      | Office home | ~948 ms | 166–263; 187 ms |

      **Chosen by the user (25 Oct, "Yes: make the build I install non-debuggable"), 6e4a37f:** the debug build is not debuggable
      (`./gradlew assembleDebug -Pdebuggable` for one that is), same key, installed over the app on the phone with nothing lost.
      Logs moved to /sdcard/Android/data/com.kalotrapezis.drive/files/logs (adb reads them without run-as; Send log shares from
      there). On the phone, ms, Tetra ready (tapped at once after start where it differs):

      | Applet (phone) | before (debuggable) | now (the branch, not debuggable) |
      |---|---|---|
      | Tetra's start to its first frame | 924 | 157–253 |
      | Home's first frame | 519–586 | 83–100 |
      | Data | 2353–2426 | 157–194 |
      | Notes | 348–407 | 45–66 |
      | Calendar | 268–291 | 32–35 |
      | Photos | 619–667 at once | 266–375 at once |
      | Office home | 711–881 | 59–65 |
      | Files | 159–173 | 37–49 |
      | Timer | 226–246 | 38–52 |
      | Contacts | 157–218 | 32–38 |

      **The desktop (25 Oct, Drive branch `optimise`, beta.21; merged into Drive main c62fb2f; the .deb built for the user to install):** measured hidden on a copy of the library
      (Drive/desktop/scripts/measure.js: each page's time until it stops changing, and the longest task that kept the window
      from answering). Already quick and left: Files, Notes, Calendar, Timer, Maps, Contacts, Data, Devices, Settings
      (2–160 ms, no task over ~90 ms). Two froze the window:

      | Page | before | after | what was slow |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Photos (opened again) | 741 ms, the window busy 599 ms | 71 ms, none | every one of the 16 619 photos was made at each visit; now a period's photos are made within two screens of the view and let go farther away (its room kept), so any size of library opens the same |
      | Phone | 510–545 ms, busy 288–293 ms | 47–76 ms, none | the phone's thousand recent calls made at once; now sixty, more as the list's end nears |

      Measuring on the phone: `am force-stop` then `am start` at once leaves HyperOS's recents_animation_input_consumer over the
      screen and adb's taps are lost; press HOME in between (memory phone-tap-measuring).

      Notes also has a keyboard now (the user, 25 Oct: "can we add keyboard support"), the desktop's keys: in the list Ctrl+N a
      note, Ctrl+Shift+N a checklist, Ctrl+F search, Esc a step back; in a note Esc leaves, Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y (Ctrl+Shift+Z) undo
      and redo, Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I bold and italic. Tried on the tablet with adb's key combinations.

      | Applet | before | after | what was slow |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | Notes (218 notes) | 1000 / 740 / 1043 ms | 435 / 315 / 608 ms | every note file read and parsed twice per open (the Trash sweep, then the list) before anything showed; four Regexes built per line of every card. Now: read ahead at start, a file read again only when it changed, the sweep after the list shows, Regexes made once. Made for thousands of notes (the user: "think ahead"): the list keeps only each card (title, the lines it shows, labels, dates), a tap reads the whole note from its file, an index file in the app's cache (147 KB for 218 notes) shows the list at once however many there are, files changed since are read again; search's index is read from the files while search is open and let go after; what is kept follows the folder (Tetra open for months holds no deleted note). What is left is laying out ~12 cards of text (debug build) |
      | Home | 431–501 ms first frame after start; 200 ms back from an applet | 363–404 ms; 97–111 ms (taps at once) | fifteen 627 px art pictures decoded full size on the UI thread at the first layout; Local Sync's line read its database on the UI thread; the Contacts and Phone groups read every contact's file again. Now: the pictures made small once off the UI thread, read ahead at start, one each for good; the line read off it; the groups take Contacts' read-ahead. What is left: ~450 ms of process start before Tetra's code (debug build), then measuring ~14 groups' text the first time |
      | Files (root; the Trash's 371 files) | 393 / — / 491 ms; listing 371 files 124 ms warm, 393 cold | 343 / 184 / 462 ms; 41 ms warm, 253 cold | each file's real path asked four times while listing (a chain of calls on shared storage each), dates read again in every comparison when sorting by Modified, the colour and tag maps parsed again for each row drawn, 50 recents and the favourites checked on disk on the UI thread at each open. Now one look at each file (a link still followed and kept inside Tetra), its date and size kept for sorting and thumbnails, the maps read once per list, recents and favourites off the UI thread, and Files opened again shows its list at once while it reads it again |
      | Calendar (388 + 3 calendars' events, 878 in the window) | 998 ms opened; 1172–1354 at once; a cold start's read 1.9–2.2 s | ~795 ms; 960–1326; 0.77–0.9 s | it composed empty, then read every event file and composed again; the by-day map was made on the UI thread; each file's size and time asked twice; the reminders and the screen parsed the same files at once; deleted events stayed in memory. Now (with the user's idea, "the calendar does not change that often… keep it on disk"): an index file per calendar in the app's cache keeps each event's essentials between starts, and only a file whose size or time changed — a change here, from sync, from Claude's skill — is read again; the events read ahead at start, the Calendar composes once with them; a file's whole is read only when export or a birthday asks; one reader at a time, at a background priority. What is left is composing the Day view the first time (~500 ms in a debug build). The measures of this row were taken together; the tablet ran ~250 ms slower then than for the rows above |
      | Timer | 366–371 ms; 495–635 at once | 334–343; 438–606 | the timers' service check read their files on the UI thread before the cards, and the clean-up of sync's copies came first too; now the cards first, both after, off the UI thread |
      | Data | 1556–1942 ms; 2347–2912 at once | 853–965; 1065–1443 | today's counts asked of Android (a second and more), the jobs scheduled, then the month files read: the page waited for all of it; the plan file read again at every recomposition. Now what is written shows first and today's counts follow |
      | Office (home) | 2132–2137 ms; 2634–2743 at once | ~948 (2255 the first time, before its cache); 1106–1305 | every open walked the whole library (~700 folders on the tablet) to show the newest ten of each kind; now the list from the last look (the app's cache) shows at once and the walk runs behind it |
      | Words (Test-Words/Tetra test.docx) and a PDF | Words 1779 ms the first in a session (read 16 ms, pages 55 ms, then one 1.64 s frame), 181–191 ms after; PDF 242–257 ms, ~170 after | not changed | the file is read and laid out in well under 0.1 s; the first document's wait is Words' own code running for the first time in a debug build (the phone's fonts, read then too, are at most ~30 ms of it, so they are not read ahead). The non-debuggable build is the cure |
- [ ] **Next, in this order** (the user, 25 Oct): (1) wait for the two agents now running — sync's clean-up of what Data
      leaves behind, and Contacts' call history with recordings — then merge everything; (2) one agent optimises every
      other applet one by one with Contacts' speed recipe (Notes is slow to show its notes; Files, Scanner, Timer, Calendar
      should be fast; Office may stay slower), measured before → after on the phone; (3) translations for every applet:
      **Greek first, then the EU languages, one string file per language** (Android values-<lang>/strings.xml; the desktop
      one file per language); short words preferred, and what still doesn't fit ends with "…" (no wrapping, no shrinking);
      (4) then push to GitHub as a fuller product.
      (5) **No more applets until "a baby can use this thing"** (the user, 25 Oct). Before any new applet:
      (5a) Home's **default layout is a grid of small icons** (Home edit's Small size), so a new user isn't overwhelmed; the
      big groups stay one tap away in edit mode. (5b) A **step-by-step guide with graphics** on first start: pair with the
      computer, every permission and why it is asked (files, photos, notifications, exact alarms, contacts, phone/calls,
      usage access, location for Maps/Wi-Fi), and how to customise Home — change, resize and move icons. Skippable, and
      reachable again from Settings. (5c) **A first-run simulation**: a fresh install from 0 (empty app data, no pairing, a
      new emulator and a fresh desktop data folder) to check everything still works from the very start, and fix what
      doesn't. (6) The next big step after that: **Android as server and client, and the desktop as server and client**
      (today the computer is the hub and devices pair only with it).
      **26 Oct, the user changed (5b) and (6):** (5b) the guide is graphical, step by step — "click here, choose here,
      allow this because this", moving, copying and so on — with screenshots or replicated UI, and the user can go
      through it many times when they don't remember something, using it while reading it to learn. (6) "On the sync
      front the structure does not change at all. I don't want Android to work as a server because some of the features
      won't work there, there are too many restrictions. I want the desktop to be able to connect as a client, so we need
      a phrase, a password, that we can copy, the key. Right now the server is the PC and waits for a QR code. I want to
      choose when the app opens what it is, the server or the client; the relationship can't be changed after, except
      with a reset of the app and a forced backup, or a double acknowledgement of full deletion of the Tetra folder, with
      the second acknowledgement having a 10-second wait before the Reset is actionable." Order (26 Oct): both at once in
      two sessions; the guide does its pairing/first-start chapter last, from the role session's screens.
- [x] (desktop-role session, 26 Oct, Drive c468535 on main, not pushed, nothing installed) **(6) The desktop as a sync client.** Agreed with the user
      26 Oct: first start asks Server or Client, locked after; a client syncs everything a phone does (Files, Notes, Photos,
      people/favourites/albums); the key is a short one-use phrase (10 min) typed or copied, found on the same network as
      phones; Settings › Reset: a verified backup to a chosen folder then everything cleared, or two acknowledgements of
      deleting the Tetra folder, the second clickable after 10 s. Android unchanged.
      Built (SYNC_PLAN.md 6as): `client.js` (join by phrase, sync as a phone), `reset.js`, `src/Role.tsx`; the server's
      code is unchanged except the phrase, the beacon's answer to it and a client refusing all but "sync now". 49 strings in
      all 24 languages; 156 desktop tests pass; run end to end with two hidden instances (server and client) on this PC.
      Not run between two real computers. **Screens settled, for the setup guide's pairing chapter:** in the group's notes
      folder, `role-screens/` (PNGs + README): first start's question → server's Devices (QR + key + Copy) → client types
      the key → server's card for the new computer (rules Off until chosen) → client's Devices "Syncs with …" → Settings ›
      Server or client (Back up and reset… / Delete everything and reset… with the 10 s countdown) → the question again.
      26 Oct, the user on the first-start page: keep the words Server/Client (Διακομιστής/Πελάτης) but explain them "as if
      to small children", sparse, step by step — done on Drive main (four short lines under Server, three under Client, a
      red "changing this later can lead to data loss"; Settings › Server or client shows the same lines).
- [x] (desktop-role session, 26 Oct, Drive 5b1c134 on main, nothing installed, **untried on two real computers** — all Alpha) **A client PC gets the phone features too, and a server can be a NAS** (the user, 26 Oct,
      answering what a client PC misses). No favourite PC ("over-engineering"). (1) Calls: the bubble on every computer
      "like a switch"; Answer on one takes it there; End or Decline anywhere ends it on the phone; calling from a client
      goes through the server. The sound on the computer where it was answered: "Bluetooth > Wi-Fi > speaker" — from the
      phone by Bluetooth to whichever computer holds it (the server if it has Bluetooth), then over Wi-Fi to the one that
      answered, and back the same way; End: Wi-Fi > Bluetooth > end. (2) Maps:
      the phone's location goes to every computer where Maps is open. (3) Data: every computer gets all the counts, for
      per-app use and losses. (4) Shared files: unchanged, they land on the server and follow each card's copy/move.
      (5) "This is a NAS" tick on the Server card: it keeps files and backups; screen work (call bubbles, notifications,
      reminders, timers) and the slow photo analysis fall to the next computer in line — one client holds "the crown"
      (the first to join, by itself); until a real computer gets it, those stay off on the NAS. (6) A client's Devices
      page shows drives, Deleted items and History.
      (7) Maps on a computer (the user, 26 Oct: "PCs and laptops in general don't move much"): the phone's last fix is
      kept and reused; Settings › Location says how long — Off (default: until Where I am is pressed), every half hour,
      once a day, once a week; Where I am always asks the phone. **Later:** "active GPS on PC while in active navigation"
      — when desktop Maps gets real turn-by-turn navigation (it has routes only).
      Built (SYNC_PLAN.md 6at): (1)–(3), (5)–(7). Tested in desktop/test/client.test.js with a stand-in phone (a call
      shown on the client, answered there through the server, every computer told who took it; Maps' fix; a call placed
      from the client; the crown to the first client; the sound crossing both ways). Screens checked on two hidden
      instances. **Not checked on real hardware:** a real call's sound relayed between two computers, and Bluetooth when
      two computers both reach for the phone — needs the user, two computers and the phone.
      Same day, more (the user): **the mirror** — on a client, Devices › "Show <server>'s photos here": the server's
      photos in the gallery (a server badge on each) and as an album, only thumbnails kept; one opened comes over Wi-Fi,
      the last 1 GB opened stays; never deleted from the client. **Beta and Alpha** — the first start opens with a card
      saying what they mean (Tetra is Beta; Alpha = new, not tried on the equipment it is for); everything needing a
      second computer is labelled Alpha (Client, NAS, the key for a computer, a client's Devices, the mirror, "sound
      over Wi-Fi"); a pill beside "Tetra" top-left: Alpha (red) on a client or NAS, Beta (orange) otherwise. The user
      has no second computer, so all of this stays Alpha until tried. Screens: role-screens/ in the notes folder.
- [ ] **Later (the user, 26 Oct):** "a dummy setup so we can make a video for the page, and put an FAQ in the footer" — a
      demo install (fresh data folders, invented photos/files/people, a server and a client and a phone) to record the
      setup on video for Tetra's page, and an FAQ in the page's footer. Not started.

- [x] (Drive `sync-one-writer`, sync-copies session, 25 Oct) Sync's "(2)", "(3)", "(4)" of a file only the phone writes (Data's
      month file): the computer took a path it had just asked for as agreed before the upload came; a late upload (a part's and
      the whole sync at once) or one that never came then made a conflict and an offer of the computer's older copy back to the
      phone. Fixed in desktop `files.js`/`sync.js` only (SYNC_PLAN.md 6aq); test in `sync.test.js`; 136 desktop tests pass. Not
      merged, not run between real devices; the phone needs no new APK.
- [~] (Drive `sync-same-size` / Drive-Android `claude/sync-same-size`, sync-copies session, 25 Oct evening) 6aq did not stop
      them: the phone's storage keeps a renamed-over file's first date and both sides cache hashes by size and date, so a
      same-length new month looked like the old one; memory that disagreed never healed. Fixed both sides (SYNC_PLAN.md 6ar);
      desktop 148 + Android unit 658 pass. Not merged, not installed, not run between real devices.

## Waiting on the user
- [x] (answered 18 Oct) **Touch targets**: the Office settings decide — the user: "The tab look compact normal and desktop mode
  (Top bottom) is all settings in the Office section". Done: with the tools Normal, the tab row's tabs and the icon-only tools are
  48 dp (all three apps, ribbon at the top or bottom); Compact (chosen, or By itself with a mouse) keeps the smaller look. See A › Touch points.
- [x] (answered 18 Oct) **Tables' AutoSave**: kept shared — the user: AutoSave is one setting in Settings › Office, "the same will
  apply to all office apps" (Words, Tables, Slides alike).
- (office-F, 18 Oct, 05:00) **Office's last big pieces — which first, or later?** Words, Slides and Tables' lines in this plan are now
  done or marked later, except these, each a day or more: (1) Slides › File › Save as the other format (.pptx ⇄ .odp: a whole-deck
  writer for each) [done 18 Oct: the deck rebuilt in the other format, see B › File]; (2) copying slides between decks (PowerPoint's Reuse slides) [done 18 Oct]; (3) editing the slide master [done 18 Oct: things on every slide; a Slide Master view later]; (4) View › Zoom on the
  slide being edited [done 18 Oct, see B › View]; (5) audio, Words' Online video, a film's start and end in Slides [done 18 Oct: audio, a film's Trim; Online video 17 Oct]; (6) rich text typed in a Tables cell (part bold) [done 18 Oct, 0c6f13b];
  (7) character spacing in all three (the shared engine) [done 18 Oct]. The "later"s with evidence (none of the 29 decks uses them): slide tables'
  merge/split, pictures' brightness/contrast, SmartArt, right-to-left text.
  Overnight (05:10) the main session chose an order so the work goes on — smallest and least risky first: (4), (7), (6), (2), (3),
  (1), (5). Change it in the morning if you like; each is a commit of its own, ticked here as it is done.
- (23 Oct) **Contacts**: the plan's nine questions (§ Contacts › Questions for the user); nothing is built before the yes.
- (24 Oct) **Phone (the dialer)**: on main (§ Phone); waiting: the OK to install on the phone and the desktop .deb, question 2
  (the phone's own recording) and 6 (the colour).

## Office: Slides and Tables as full as Words, then a UI/UX pass over all three (planned 17 Oct; moved here from OFFICE_FEATURES.md)

**Why (the user, 17 Oct):** Slides' and Tables' ribbons look empty next to Words'. Words was built over weeks with the
user at every step; the other two were built by Claude alone. On 17 Oct the ribbons held: Words 12 tabs, 127 buttons;
Tables about 7 tabs, 74; Slides 8 tabs, 35. The lists below come from what the desktop apps offer (PowerPoint and
Excel, LibreOffice Impress and Calc), cut to what makes sense on a tablet and phone without a cloud. **Order: the
UI/UX pass's shared pieces first (so new tools land on one base), then Slides, then Tables, each list top-down.**
Every item is checked on the tablet and phone and against LibreOffice, as Words' were.

### A. UI/UX pass — how all three are tested, and what is made the same
**How it is tested** (written up as a TEST_TREE-style walk, ticked per app):
- [ ] **Every tab, every button**, on the tablet (971f6b37) and the phone: ribbon at the bottom and at the top,
      normal and compact, finger and mouse. Each must work, show what it did, undo, and survive a save (the saved file
      opened in LibreOffice).
- [ ] **Lag**: each action timed in writer.log (Tables already logs slow frames; Words and Slides to do the same) and
      `dumpsys gfxinfo … framestats` around it. Aims: a tap answered within 100 ms, no frame over 32 ms while
      scrolling, a slide or sheet switch within 200 ms. The worst ten fixed first.
- [~] **Touch points**: a script dumps each screen's layout (uiautomator) and flags any tappable thing smaller than
      48 dp (compact mode excepted only with a mouse). Plus a hand check of resize handles, small chips and close
      buttons, things near the screen's edges (Android's back gesture), and gestures that fight (pinch against drag).
      Script done and run (office-F session, 17 Oct, emulator 1280×800 at 160 dpi, editing, every ribbon tab): `tools/touch-targets.py
      <device> <tab>…`. Words 143, Slides 125, Tables 52 small targets (lists: touch-targets/ in the group's notes folder). The same few
      shared things every time: the tab row's tabs 41–43 dp tall (`OfficeTabRow`); icon-only tools 40–46 dp wide (`Tool` 40 dp, `Swatches`:
      Bold, Italic, Text colour, Fill, Fewer decimals…); the top bar's Undo, Redo, Save, Find 40 dp; Words' References › 1 2 3 35 dp; an
      unnamed 25–41 dp thing at the ribbon's right edge in Words' Home, Layout, Review and Slides' Insert (the edge: Android's back
      gesture). Done 18 Oct (office-F, the user's answer: the Office settings decide): in Normal size every tab is at least 48 dp tall
      (`OfficeTabRow`, 2 dp under it so the tools' touch areas do not reach into it), the icon-only tools 48 dp (`LocalToolSize` /
      `RibbonTools` inside the ribbons and Words' top bar — Notes and the text editor keep 40 dp), a labelled button at least 48 dp
      across (1 2 3 4, X², H1); Compact is as before. Re-run in Normal (emulator, every tab of all three): Words 0, Tables 2, Slides 2 —
      those four are the next button cut off where the ribbon line scrolls on (full size once in view). Words' fingerprint unchanged.
      Before/after shots: touch-targets/ribbon-48dp-before-after.png in the group's notes. Hand check: on the tablet.
- [ ] **Inconsistencies**: the checklist below, the three apps side by side on the tablet. Each difference is made
      the same or written down as deliberate.

**The tablet walk, 18 Oct 07:10–07:50 (main session, build 19781a2 on 971f6b37)** — fixed by the office-strips session in this order:
- [x] 1. Slides › Home › Paragraph: OK with only Line spacing changed puts the first paragraph's indent on every paragraph (sub-points
      lose their level). Only the fields changed are applied.
- [x] (the user, 18 Oct: "add a select mode in tables under selection") Tables › Selection › Select cells: while on, one finger dragged
      chooses cells at once (no long press); two fingers still move and zoom. Off: a long press, then drag, as before.
- [x] 2. Slides › Multilevel: the "1. / 1.1. / 1.1.1." card gives "1." at level 2 — dropped for slides (PowerPoint and Impress have no legal numbering).
- [x] 3. Slides: no gap between a number and its words ("1.Read") in the editor while unsaved; saved, level 2 has it, level 1 not. Now a number
      hangs half an inch (PowerPoint's 457200) and the .pptx gets exactly the indents the editor drew (test `numbered paragraphs drawn and saved alike`).
- [x] 4. Tables › Remove duplicates: a whole column (header tapped) refused; formula cells refused after the dialog (Excel compares
      values); "The first row is headers" ticked even when row 1 is data. Now: a column's letter takes the column, nothing chosen the table
      round the cell; formulas compared by what they show; headers ticked only for words over numbers.
- [x] 5. Tables: on a protected sheet a tap does not choose the cell, nothing says why — choose it, refuse typing with a message.
      Now the first tap on a locked cell says the sheet is protected (once per sheet); typing is refused with it. Found on the way: a tap
      in the ~1 s while the sheet is read again after a whole-file step (Protect, Hide…) is lost — the grid's gestures restart on the new
      sheet (`pointerInput(painter)`); [ ] keep them across a reload (the callbacks through rememberUpdatedState).
- [x] 6. Slides: Save clears Undo — all three keep the history over a save. Slides now keeps the deck and Undo; the file as opened is kept
      aside and each save writes the edits onto it (Tables did so already, Words never cleared it). A new slide size still starts afresh.
- [x] 7. Tables › Sheet › Unhide popup → strip (7ee3675).
- [x] 8. Slides › View › Zoom popup → strip (7ee3675).
- [x] 9. Slides › Insert › Table: "‹ Table" (7ee3675); one shared table-size picker with Words' Insert › Table. Now `TableSizeButton`
      in both: the size dragged out on a grid, on a strip on tablet/phone (✓ puts it in), in Words' window on a desktop.
- [x] 10. Words › Page numbers in Insert and in Layout, once a strip, once a list — one form. Layout has no Page numbers; its list was
      Line numbers, now cards on the pages' strip as Insert › Page numbers (7ee3675).
- [x] 11. Duplicates: Tables Sheet › Protect vs Review › Protect sheet; Formulas › Insert function vs Insert › Function; Show formulas
      in Formulas and View; AutoSum in Home and Formulas; Slides' Selection pane in Home and in the Shape tab — one place, or one form.
      Now: the sheet's tab says "Protect sheet" as Review does; Insert › Function is Formulas' Insert function (the same window); Show
      formulas only on Formulas (Excel's place); AutoSum and the Selection pane were already the same in both places (as Excel/PowerPoint).
- [x] 12. Slides › Design: after Save, Apply to all and Reset background go although the slide keeps its own background.
- [x] 13. Slides › View: Notes page leaves Normal highlighted; Normal does not hide the notes — exclusive, or a "Notes" toggle. Now PowerPoint's
      Show › Notes, a toggle of its own beside the views.
- [x] 14. Slides › View › Outline: sub-points at the main points' level, without their numbers. Now each line at its level, its
      bullet or number before it (drawn only; the words typed as before).
- [-] 15. Shadow "Offset: bottom right" barely visible in Slides, clear in Words — draw the same. They are drawn by one function
      (`ShapePicture.shadowOf`: 3 pt down-right, 40 % black, as the file says); a slide is ~1.6× a page's width, so on screen the same 3 pt
      looks smaller — as in PowerPoint next to Word. Kept as the file has it (deliberate; ask the user if a stronger look is wanted).
- [x] 16. Slides › Ungroup leaves nothing chosen (PowerPoint keeps the pieces); Undo after Paragraph drops the choice. Now the pieces
      stay chosen; Undo and Redo keep what is chosen while it is still on the slide.
- [x] 17. Slides: a table cell being typed is not marked on the slide. Now outlined and tinted in the app's colour.
- [x] 18. The ribbon's height jumps a few px between tabs (Slides Home vs Group/Shape; Tables Home vs View). Now every ribbon line is at
      least a tool tall (48 dp, Compact 40) inside its padding, in all three apps.
- [x] 19. Some ribbons centred (Design, Arrange, Sheet), others from the left (View) when they fit — one. Now all from the left (Office's
      way; a long tab has to start there anyway), in all three apps and the strips.
- [x] 20. Words' contextual tab row lacks Selection / × at its start when a shape is chosen (Slides and Tables have it). Now ×, which
      lets go of the picture, shape or table. Selection stays for words (Words' Cut/Copy work on text; a picture has its own tab).
- [x] 21. Tables' top bar has no Find (Words and Slides have it). Now before Undo, while editing too.
- [x] 22. Words › Insert › Shapes › Block arrows: left-right and up-down arrows drawn as diamonds. Their drawing was right — in a square
      the two heads meet (Word's too); now the gallery draws each in its proportions and puts it in at Word's size, one rule for all
      three apps (`shapeSize`: ⇔ 2:1, ⇕ 1:2; Slides used to put every shape in square).
- [x] (the user, 18 Oct, Tetra test.docx: "the position of [the text box] is different in Edit mode than Viewer mode … in edit mode it
      climbs around 5 lines and goes in front of [the text]") Words: a box placed freely on the page (in front, behind, no wrap) is
      drawn in the editor from its paragraph's top, as the pages lay it out; a box alone in its paragraph has its mark as given
      (\uFFFC), which the editor's paragraph finder did not look for — its paragraph was "not found", the box measured from the one
      before. Now found either way; the editor matches the viewer (emulator, the user's file). Unit 507, 0 failing.
Found on the way (office-strips, emulator, not fixed):
- [ ] Slides: a table put on a slide over a text box is drawn on top, but a tap there chooses the box under it (the hit test's order
      is not the drawing's).
- [ ] Slides › Numbering on "Olive harvest talk.pptx" gives "1. • Olives…": that deck's bullets are typed "•" letters, not PowerPoint
      bullets — Numbering could take a typed "• " / "- " off the line's start as PowerPoint's AutoCorrect does.
Working on the tablet: speaker notes, Select all/Group/drag/Ungroup, Distribute, Reset, Shape options Dash/Shadow (both), Gradient, Slide
size 16:9 Ensure fit, table Row below, Zoom 200% + pan, Fade + Fly In, the show letterboxed; Words' heart with dot + shadow; Tables'
Gridlines, column Hide, sheet Hide/Unhide, Protect/Unprotect; LibreOffice opens all three saved copies; touch targets Tables 2 (edge-cut).
Not walked yet: Tables Merge & centre, Replace, Chart, Link, Text to columns, Insert function, rich-text cell; Words beyond Insert/Shapes.

**The tablet walk, second round, 18 Oct 08:48–09:00 (main session, at acb4526 on 971f6b37)** — confirmed there: Slide size strip (3:2 saved
as 35mm, Ensure fit), Themes strip, Colours cards, Paragraph keeps levels, numbers' gap, Save keeps Undo, Tables' Find, Select cells, Merge
& centre, part-bold cell, Insert function's window, touch targets. To fix (office-strips session, in this order):
- [x] 1. DATA LOSS — Tables: C13 typing "=SUM(B1," then a long-press drag over B2:B4 moved the edit to B2; ")" and Enter wrote
      "=SUM(B1,B4" over B2 (AutoSave saved it). While a formula is typed a drag (plain, long press, Select cells) puts the range in at
      the cursor; it never changes the cell being edited; Enter writes to the cell the edit started in. (The user: "After a formula like
      SUM is in place can the user just click on cells and add them to the formula?" — yes, as Excel.)
- [x] 2. A tap adds a cell's name (keep); a drag adds nothing today — the gap. Now (1, 2): the cell being typed is fixed when typing starts
      (Enter writes there, the bar names it); while a formula is typed one finger dragged — plainly, after a long press, or in Select
      cells — names the range at the cursor, growing as it goes ("B2:B4"), the chosen cell untouched; two fingers move the sheet.
      Emulator: E2 "=SUM(" + drag B2:B4 + "," + tap D2 + ")" ✓ → =SUM(B2:B4,D2) = 5952 in E2.
      The user on the tablet, 18 Oct: "it works but it does not show the selection so I know easily where to stop" — now the range
      being dragged is outlined on the sheet (Excel's dashed blue over a light tint) while the finger moves.
      And: "if I tap and then drag … it gets sum(K2K2:K20" — now, as Excel's pointing, the reference a tap or drag put in last, with
      nothing typed after it, is replaced by the next tap or drag (B2 tapped, then B2:B5 dragged → "=SUM(B2:B5"; after a "," a new one).
      ✓ with a ")" missing closes it (as Excel). And (the user: "Do we have syntax help warning as well? … for missing a "," or a "(" | }
      that kind of thing"): the function's syntax shows above the keyboard while typing (it did); now a formula Tables cannot read is
      not put in at the first ✓ — the message says what is wrong ("a comma or an operator missing before “C2”", "a ) with no (",
      "it ends too soon"…), ✓ again keeps it as typed (Excel's arrays { } and table [ ] references, which Tables does not read).
- [x] 3. Formulas › Insert function › SUM: "=SUM(" in the bar but not editing (no ✓ ×, no keyboard, taps not added); tapping the bar
      throws it away; leaving saved "=SUM(" into the cell. It must open the bar for editing, the cursor inside the brackets.
      Not reproduced on the emulator (ribbon top and bottom, a hardware keyboard): there the bar opens with ✓ ×, the cursor in "=SUM(".
      Made robust: the typing (and its cell) is set before the bar takes the focus, and Enter or leaving never writes an unfinished
      function — missing ")" are closed as Excel does, "=SUM(" stays in the bar with a note (`SheetInput.closed`, tested). [ ] On the
      tablet with the keyboard case: the steps again, then File › Send log, to see what closed the typing there. The user, 18 Oct, on the
      tablet with the keyboard case: "it works — I can type, it has the buttons, I can choose cells and press Enter to apply".
- [x] 4. With a keyboard: typing on a chosen cell does nothing, a double tap does not open it — Excel starts typing on both. Now a key
      typed on a chosen cell starts its typing afresh (every key kept), Enter or F2 opens what is in it, the arrows move; a double tap
      opens the cell. Emulator (hardware keys): F3 "4278" Enter; B3 double-tapped → its 1850 in the bar.
- [x] 5. Search forgives a wrong letter ("Hello" finds "Yellow fill"); Replace / Replace all must change exact matches only. They did
      change only exact ones, but said so badly; now Replace takes the one shown or the next exact one, Replace all every exact one and
      says how many near matches it left as found.
- [x] 6. Two strip forms: "‹ title … × ✓" (Slide size, Themes) and "title … Cancel OK" (Colours, Multilevel, Line numbers cards) — one form.
      Now the card strips (`DesignGalleryStrip`: Colours, Fonts, Font, Style sets, WordArt, Page and Line numbers, Header & footer,
      Multilevel, Drop cap) have the same head: ‹ and the name, × and ✓ at the end; on a phone the head on its own line over the cards.
- [x] 7. Slide size: the size picked is not shown on the slide before ✓ (Themes and Colours are). Now shown (fitted) at the tap; ✓ asks
      Maximize or Ensure fit; × puts it back. With other changes unsaved it is only marked (✓ offers Save first, as before).
      Unit 506, 0 failing, 7 skipped (at this commit). Emulator only; the tablet was not touched.

**Made the same** (one shared component where today each app has its own code):
- [x] **The tab indicator**: Words drew a bubble behind the chosen tab; Tables and Slides a dash under it. Now one
      shared tab row for all three (`OfficeTabRow`, OfficeUi.kt: each app's tabs, its dash colour, the contextual
      tab's own colour, the chosen tab scrolled clear of the edge's shade). **Settings › Office and File › Settings:
      "Tab marker: Bubble / Dash"** (bubble by default, as Words had it). Compact always uses the dash, for the room.
      Checked on the tablet in all three apps, both markers, normal and compact (17 Oct).
- [x] (386b04c) Tab names and order: Selection first when something is chosen, then File, Home, Insert, … as Words'; the
      contextual tab (Picture, Table, Column, Row, Sheet) comes by itself, in one place and colour in every app.
      Done: Slides' "Slide" tab is Home (PowerPoint's Slides group is on Home); what is chosen on a slide has its own
      last tab named by it (Text box, Image, Table, Chart, Shape) — Slides' Selection tab is left for Cut/Copy/Paste
      (B); the contextual tab is a lighter tone of each app's colour. The picture's tab is **Image** in Words and
      Slides (the user, 17 Oct: "It should be Image not Picture" — 386b04c had renamed it, put back). Tablet 17 Oct.
- [x] File holds the same items in every app: Save, Versions, Export PDF, Print, Share, Open in another app, About
      this file, Send log, Settings. Slides lacks Versions, Export PDF, Print, About and Send log today; the checklist
      above says Slides' Export PDF is done, but its File tab has no such button, so check that line.
      Done: Slides had no Export PDF (the ticked line was Words'); now all of them (`Slides.pdf`: a page a slide at the
      deck's size, hidden slides left out; Versions opens one unsaved, Save puts it over the file), one shared
      `VersionsDialog` for Tables and Slides (Words keeps its page previews), the same order in all three, Words gains
      Open in another app. Tablet 17 Oct: PDF of 4 slides; a version opened and saved, LibreOffice opens it.
- [x] Every button has an icon (memory: ribbon icons); the everyday tools on the ribbon and the rest under ⋯ on a
      full page (memory: ribbon ⋯ button) — in Slides and Tables too.
      Done: every action in Tables and Slides has one (new: filter off, fewer/more decimals; A−/A+ as Words' − size +);
      choices stay words as Words' style names do (speeds, sides, transition kinds, number formats, table sizes). No
      Tables or Slides tab overflows yet, so nothing is behind ⋯ — B and C add tools under that rule. Tablet 17 Oct.
- [x] Strips (Words' Page numbers, Tables' Borders and Number) open the same way: ‹ back, a title, sliding in.
      Done: one `StripHead` (‹ and the name) for Tables' Borders and Number and Slides' Transition options, Effect and
      Effect options, which now take the whole ribbon's place and slide in as Tables' do. Deliberate difference: Words'
      galleries (Page numbers, Fonts, Colours, WordArt…) keep their name with Cancel and OK — they preview on the page
      and need OK. Checked on the emulator (1280 dp) 17 Oct; the tablet was in the user's hands.
- [x] One colour picker (Words' swatches; Slides has its own `SLIDE_COLOURS`), one font picker, one size picker.
      Done: the picker (`Swatches`) and the font gallery were already shared; now the lists are too — `TEXT_COLOURS`
      (white added, for dark fills and slides), `HIGHLIGHT_COLOURS`, `CELL_FILLS` (Words' table shading and Tables'
      Fill) and Words' `SHAPE_COLOURS` for a slide's shapes (`SLIDE_COLOURS` gone); `FontButton` and `SizeStepper` in
      Words and Tables (Tables: font then size, as Words'). Slides gets them with B's Home. Emulator 17 Oct.
- [x] The top bar: Undo, Redo, Save and Done in the same places; the status text (counts, Saved / Not saved) worded
      alike. View-only on opening with Edit, the Save / Don't save question on leaving, recovery drafts and versions
      behave the same in all three.
      Done: Words' eye ("Pages", before Find) is Done ✓ at the far right, where Edit stands when viewing, as in Tables
      and Slides; the unsaved dot before the name in all three (Words' "• name"); Words' status ends with the file type
      as the others' (".docx"); **Slides keeps a recovery draft** when sent to the background with changes (it had
      none): reopened, "Your unsaved changes are back", unsaved — Save keeps them, Don't save drops them. View-only on
      opening, the leave question and Versions were already alike. Emulator 17 Oct (draft: hid a slide, Home, killed
      the app, reopened, saved — LibreOffice skips the hidden slide).
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts and right-click menus the same where the action is the same (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+C/V, Delete).
      Done: Slides takes Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V for what is chosen on a slide (as its right-click menu); Tables' Delete
      empties the chosen cells, as Excel's. All three: Ctrl+S, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z. Ctrl+F: Words and
      Tables; Slides gets it with B's Find and Replace. Right-click menus were already one component (`OfficeMenu`) with
      Cut, Copy, Paste first in Tables and Slides; Words' text uses Android's own menu (deliberate: the system's text
      selection). Emulator 17 Oct.
- [x] (16 Oct, `RibbonRows`) A ribbon on rows on a big screen: with the ribbon at the top on a screen 840 dp or wider,
      each tab's tools go on as many rows as they need, a whole group moving to the next row (never one tool). The
      user, 17 Oct, shown it: **keep it in all three apps** — new tools in B and C go through `RibbonLine`, which does it.
- [x] Messages, empty states and dialogs in one style; English only (memory: UI English only).
      Done: one `OfficeMessage` — Words' black pill at the top for 2.8 s, written in the log — in all three (Tables'
      was a grey box at the bottom for 3.5 s, Slides' a see-through box for 2.5 s). Dialogs were already Material's
      AlertDialog everywhere; "Opening…" and "could not be opened" already worded alike; all English.
      Also (the user, 17 Oct: "Slides' ribbon does not stick"): on a tablet Save and Delete slide left no slide
      chosen, so Slides' ribbon went away; now the slide stays chosen. Emulator 17 Oct.

### B. Slides — what PowerPoint and Impress have that Slides lacks
Foundation first: **a slide's words as runs** (today an edited paragraph is one line in its first run's look,
`SlidesEdit.withTexts`) — needed by most of Home and by References. **The user, 17 Oct, changed this into the shared
engine** (below, "The Office engine"): no third text model — Words' paragraphs and runs, their layout, drawing and
effects become one engine that lays text out in any frame (a page, a slide's box or shape, later a cell).

### The Office engine — B's first item (the user, 17 Oct: "build an engine, a base Microsoft feeds off for years; after that we build upon it")
**What it is:** one way to hold, lay out and draw text, used wherever text is — a Words page, a slide's text box or
shape, a table cell on a slide, later a spreadsheet cell. Movement, turning and animation belong to the frame (the
slide's box moves, the text goes with it), as `Slides.draw` already does for items.

**What the study found (17 Oct):** Words already has most of it. `OfficePages.stack()` lays Words' paragraphs and runs
(`DocPara`/`DocRun`) into any width, and `TextBoxDrawable` puts the result in a frame (insets, top/middle/bottom,
WordArt bends) — that is how a document's text boxes are drawn today. Slides has its own simpler model (`SlideText`,
`SlidePara`, `SlideRun`) and its own drawing (Slides.kt `layouts()`/`text()`), which truncates sizes to whole points,
ignores justify, puts centred no-wrap text far off its box, re-lays all text on every frame, and loses mixed looks in a
paragraph when it is edited (`withTexts` keeps only the first run). Tables' cells have one look per cell and flatten an
.xlsx's rich text to plain. Words' typing editor (`WriterBridge`) stays as it is — it is not part of the page drawing.

**Steps, each one commit that leaves Words exactly as it was:**
- [x] 0. A check that Words is unchanged: a device test (installed + `am instrument`, never connectedAndroidTest)
      that lays out the test documents and a few with text boxes, and compares each page's lines and a picture of it
      with a stored copy. No unit test touches the drawing today, so this comes first (~80 lines).
      Done: `WordsFingerprintDeviceTest` — the six Word suite files, Test-Words' TextBox, Art, Gallery and Tetra test,
      group.odt and sections.odt (copies in androidTest/assets/fingerprint): 25 pages, each page's pieces, line ends,
      floats (a text box's lines too) and an MD5 of the page drawn at 2×, against `expected-<model>.txt` (emulator-5554
      stored; the same twice running). Run: assembleDebug assembleDebugAndroidTest, install both, `am instrument -w -e
      class com.kalotrapezis.drive.WordsFingerprintDeviceTest com.kalotrapezis.drive.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner`.
- [x] 1. Slides' text boxes and table cells drawn by Words' engine: `stack` shared; the frame gets four insets, no
      clipping (PowerPoint lets text overflow its box) and no default border; a list-marker hook so a slide's own
      bullet character and colour show; a `SlidesText.kt` adapter (a slide's text → `DocPara`s, its own `DocStyles`);
      laid text cached per box (slides are drawn often: thumbnails, animation). Fixes the four bugs above. ~120 new
      lines, ~45 removed, ~15 changed in OfficePages. **Risk:** line height — Words spaces lines as Word does, a few
      percent taller than Slides draws today; checked against LibreOffice's PDFs of real decks before it is committed.
      Done (office-engine session, 17 Oct): `SlidesText.kt` (a SlideText → DocParas with their own looks, stacked by
      `OfficePages.stack`, cached per box and size), `TextBoxDrawable.framed` (four insets, clip or not; Words' text
      boxes draw through it), DocStyles' `marker`/`markerLook` hooks (a slide's bullet character, colour, size share
      buSzPct and face buFont; LibreOffice's list font size and family). Read better too: PowerPoint's lnSpcReduction
      (was guessed from fontScale). Line height: PowerPoint's single line is 1.2 × the letters' size (LibreOffice draws
      it so), Word's the font's own — the adapter turns one into the other. Checked against LibreOffice's PDFs of 11
      decks (99 slides: the user's cronbach, lecture 3–4, counseling, phishing, ethismos, Test-Sheets' four, olive,
      slides): line breaks and line pitch now as LibreOffice's (before: lines 4–15 % apart, bullets as tofu,
      justify ignored, sizes cut to whole points); Words' fingerprint unchanged; unit suite 402 / 0 / 7; sweep 349 + 29,
      none failing. Not the engine's (seen in passing): LibreOffice re-fits normAutofit itself (lecture 3–4 bigger
      there; Tetra keeps PowerPoint's saved fontScale); small caps (cap="small") wait for step 3. Tool:
      `SlidesRenderDeviceTest` draws decks pushed to files/slides-in as PNGs.
- [x] 2. Text effects on slides: shadow, glow and outline read from PowerPoint's `a:effectLst`/`a:ln` into Words'
      `TextEffects`; WordArt bends already shared (`TextWarp`). ~40 lines.
      Done (office-engine session, 17 Oct): `SlideRun.effects` from the nearest effectLst/ln (an empty effectLst — as
      the user's jamovi decks have on every run — takes inherited ones away), LibreOffice's text-shadow/text-outline;
      drawn by Words' `EffectSpan` (the run's raw settings carry Word's w14 form). Also: an empty paragraph shows no
      bullet (PowerPoint's and LibreOffice's way; Slides drew one). `text effects read from a pptx` (text-effects.pptx).
      LibreOffice 26.2 draws a slide's text glow but not its shadow or outline from a .pptx; PowerPoint draws all three.
- [x] 3. Slides read straight into `DocPara`/`DocRun` (`SlideRun`/`SlidePara` gone): slides gain strike, sub- and
      superscript, caps, highlight, links, tabs, exact line spacing. ~150 lines.
      Done (office-engine session, 17 Oct): `SlideRun` gone — a slide's runs are `DocRun`s (face and letter looks in
      Word's form in `font`: rFonts, caps/smallCaps, dstrike, double underline, w14 effects; LibreOffice's attributes
      in an .odp); a `SlidePara` is now a `DocPara` with its `ParaLook` (spacing, indents, tab stops, exact lines) and
      `SlideBullet`. Read: strike (sngStrike, dblStrike), baseline (raised, lowered), cap (all, small), highlight,
      hyperlinks (in the theme's link colour; external targets were turned into package paths — fixed), a:tabLst,
      lnSpc spcPts; .odp: line-through, text-position, text-transform, font-variant, background colour, text:a,
      line-height in points. `letter looks read from a pptx` (text-looks.pptx). Of the 11 decks only the three that
      use these changed (cronbach's small-caps title, counseling's 19ου superscripts, jamovi's link colour), as
      LibreOffice shows them. Unit suite green; sweep 349 + 29, none failing; Words' fingerprint unchanged.
- [x] 4. Words kept per letter when a slide's text is edited (Words' `PictureXml.relaid`/`relook`, already used for
      a document's text boxes): an edited paragraph keeps its bold word and its red word; slide-number and date fields
      and line breaks kept. ~50 lines. This is "a slide's words as runs".
      Done (office-engine session, 17 Oct): saving (.pptx `SlidesEdit.withTexts`, .odp `SlidesOdpEdit` type/words) lays
      the lines over the paragraphs they came from with `PictureXml.relaid`, each letter in its run (a:r's rPr; an
      .odp's spans and links), a typed one in the look of the one before; a field left whole (a:fld, text:page-number,
      date…) stays the field, a:br/text:line-break stay (the typing field holds them as LINE_BREAK); several spaces as
      text:s. The slide shown while editing does the same (`SlidesEdit.slide`). Also: Slides now loads Tetra's fonts
      with Word's letter widths itself (only Words and Tables did: a deck opened first drew in the phone's fonts), and a
      font asked for before they are known is no longer remembered as missing. `an edited paragraph keeps each letter's
      look` (.pptx XML; LibreOffice's text-looks.odp). Emulator: cronbach slide 2 edited inside a bold word — the
      paragraph kept its bold, plain and italic words; saved, LibreOffice shows the same.
      After (17 Oct, steps 0–4): unit suite 405 tests, 0 failing, 7 skipped; sweep 349 documents and 29 decks, none
      failing; Words' fingerprint unchanged at every step (emulator-5554).
      Tablet 971f6b37 (17 Oct, 14:06–14:18): the Words fingerprint stored for it (expected-24091RPADG.txt: the same as the
      emulator's but for 3 page hashes, antialiasing); 117 slides of the 14 test decks drawn there identical to the
      emulator's but for antialiasing (no pixel off by more than 40/255), so they stand beside LibreOffice as above. In
      the app: the user's cronbach deck as LibreOffice shows it where the fonts are the same (slide 6 line for line;
      slide 3 wraps otherwise: LibreOffice has the real Century Schoolbook on the computer); Slides-test.pptx's Plan
      slide edited (a word typed, a new line: it took its level's dash and look), undone, not saved; Words' Art_test
      and TextBox_test and Tables' sheet.xlsx and Slides-test.odp as before. Seen in passing, not the engine's (its
      page is pixel-identical to before): TextBox_test's box has no bottom line on the page, the line after it covers it.
- [x] 5. The engine moved into its own file (`OfficeText.kt`): a pure move, nothing changed.
      Done (office-F session, 17 Oct): `ParaLook`, `MarkerLook`, `TabStop`/`tabGap`, the marker and tab spans, `TextBoxDrawable`, `Block`
      and `LetterLooks` moved from OfficePages.kt (U, topPt/bottomPt and the two spans now internal, as both files use them). The layout
      itself (`OfficePages.stack`, `paragraph`) stays in OfficePages: it shares some forty private helpers with Words' page layout, so
      moving it would not be a pure move. Words' fingerprint unchanged (emulator); unit 442/0/7.
- [~] 6. (with C) Tables' wrapped, shrink-to-fit and rich-text cells drawn by the engine; rich text read and written.
      Done (office-F session, 17 Oct): a cell's rich text (`SheetCell.runs`, Words' `DocRun`s; `rich` only while they still are its words)
      read from Excel's shared strings and inline strings (`Xlsx.RichRuns`: rPr b, i, u, strike, sz, colour, rFont), written back as
      Excel's runs when the cell is written (`SheetSave.runsXml`); rich, wrapped and justified cells laid out and drawn by the engine
      (`SheetPainter.cellBlock`: a paragraph a line, `OfficePages.stack` with a cell's own plain look, `TextBoxDrawable.framed` at the
      cell's vertical alignment; the old one-look StaticLayout gone); Shrink to fit read (Excel's shrinkToFit, LibreOffice's
      shrink-to-fit) and drawn (smaller letters until they fit). `rich text in a cell` (shared, Tetra's inline, LibreOffice's own save);
      emulator: "Na" bold, "me" red italic 14 pt; sheet.xlsx's merged wrapped cell in its row. The user's 31 workbooks all read.
      .ods done (office-F session, 18 Oct): LibreOffice's text:span in a cell read as the same runs (`spanLook`: its text style's own
      weight, slant, underline, strike, size, colour, font over the span it sits in) and written back as spans with text styles of
      their own (`OdsLooks.span`) when the cell is saved (a look put on it). `rich text in a cell` grew: LibreOffice's .ods of it,
      Tetra's save of that, and LibreOffice's .xlsx of Tetra's; emulator: "Na" bold, "me" red italic in an .ods.
      Not yet: rich text typed in Tables (a cell typed in is one look).
      Done 18 Oct (office-F, 0c6f13b): letters chosen while typing in a cell take Bold, Italic or Underline from the keyboard bar alone
      (Excel's); the field shows them, the runs follow the typing (`SheetRich`: kept letters keep their looks, typed ones take the look
      before them, as Words), and Enter keeps them as the cell's rich text (Excel's runs, LibreOffice's spans, both written already).
      `part of a cell's words bold while typing`. Emulator: "Hello **world**" in F8, saved — Excel's run with <b/>, LibreOffice's bold span.
- [ ] **Tests at each big step (the user, 17 Oct: "we may have to run all the tests again"):** the whole unit suite,
      the user's document sweep (`UserDocsSweepTest`, TETRA_SWEEP=1), the LibreOffice round trips, and a walk of
      Words, Slides and Tables on the tablet (TEST_TREE.md) — numbers before and after written here.
      Before (17 Oct, after the emoji fix below): unit suite 402 tests, 0 failing, 7 skipped; sweep 349 documents and
      29 decks, none failing, none copy-only. (The first sweep found one deck failing: a Google Slides .odp export
      writes emoji as two halves, "&#55357;&#56397;", which XML forbids — LibreOffice cannot open that file at all;
      Tetra now reads it and saves it whole, and LibreOffice opens Tetra's copy.)
- After the engine: Slides' Home (font, size, colours… on runs), then the rest of B, using Words' pickers and strips.
  A rich typing editor for slides (Words' own) is a later, separate project.

**Rule for A, B and C (the user, 17 Oct: "We made so much work we should use it as much as possible"):** before
writing anything for Slides or Tables, find Words' version (strips and card galleries, pickers, chart editor,
equation, symbol, link, find/replace, versions, export PDF, print, sources and citations, drawing, comments,
spelling, shapes and styles) and reuse it, moved into shared Office code where it is tied to Words. Each item says
which shared piece it uses; a separate implementation only for a real reason, said in one line.
- [x] **Home**: font, size, bold, italic, underline, strike, colour, highlight; align left, centre, right, justify;
      bullets and numbering, list level in and out; line spacing; text direction and anchor (top, middle, bottom);
      autofit (shrink on overflow, the box grows to its words); Clear formatting; Format painter.
      Done (office-engine session, 17 Oct): with a box with words chosen, Home starts with Words' own tools on all its
      words — `FontButton` + Words' font strip (`DesignGalleryStrip` Font: the deck's fonts, Word's, the phone's,
      Search; a font tapped shows at once, Cancel puts it back), `SizeStepper`, B I U S (`Tool`), `Swatches` with
      `TEXT_COLOURS`/`HIGHLIGHT_COLOURS`, Format painter (the next box chosen takes the look), Clear formatting (the
      letters' own looks gone: their level's/master's — `SlidePara.base`), Bullets / Numbering, the four alignments,
      `LINE_SPACINGS`, words at top/middle/bottom, Don't fit / Shrink text / Box fits words. Kept per box in
      `SlidesEdit.Look` (shown by `SlidesEdit.looked`), saved as PowerPoint writes them (rPr, pPr, bodyPr; a box that
      fits its words saved at its new height) and as LibreOffice does (automatic text, paragraph and list styles,
      declared font faces, the shape's graphic style). A box with words chosen keeps Home (others go to their tab).
      Found and fixed on the way: a numbered paragraph under a bulleted master read as "•" (the nearest bullet setting
      now wins); numbers counted per level as PowerPoint and LibreOffice count them (Tetra counted straight through);
      a centred list's bullet a fixed hang from its words; a slide bullet's own face no longer makes its line taller.
      Not here: list level in/out and a letter's own looks need the rich typing editor (later, as planned); text
      direction (vertical text) not done. `Home's looks on a box saved` (.pptx and .odp, read back, LibreOffice's
      conversions read back). Unit suite 407/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing; Words' fingerprint unchanged; emulator:
      slides.pptx's Plan bold, numbered, centred, 1.5, Times — saved, LibreOffice draws it the same. Tablet: not yet.
- [~] **Insert**: Text box (plain; today only shapes) — done 17 Oct (office-engine session): Insert › Text box puts a box of
      words alone (PowerPoint's txBox, no fill or line, growing to its words; LibreOffice's frame with auto-grow), typed
      into at once; anything put on but a picture or table can now be typed into and takes Home's tools; `a text box
      put on and typed into` (.pptx, .odp, LibreOffice's conversions); Chart (Words' chart editor) — done 17 Oct (office-B
      session): Words' `ChartDialog` (WORD_SAMPLE_CHART to start), held as its `DocChart` (`Added.chart`), drawn by `ChartDrawable`,
      saved by Words' `ChartWriter` (.pptx: a chart part + its workbook, as PowerPoint; .odp: LibreOffice's chart object); the
      chart's tab has Edit data. `a chart put on saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: line chart put on, turned
      into a pie by Edit data, saved — LibreOffice draws it. Not yet: Edit data on a deck's own chart (Picture / Shape below); Link (to a web page or to a
      slide) — done 17 Oct (office-B session): Words' link dialog moved into a shared `LinkDialog` (WriterTable.kt; Words uses
      it as before) with Slides' choice of "Web page" or "Slide in this deck" (the slides by their first words); a chosen box's
      words all linked (`Look.link`, the rich typing editor will link a word), nothing chosen: a text box of the words to show;
      saved as PowerPoint's hlinkClick (an outside relationship, or a slide's with ppaction://hlinksldjump) and LibreOffice's
      text:a inside each span ("#" and the page's name for a slide); Remove link; the show follows a tap on linked words (a
      web page opened, a slide gone to; an .odp's "#page" links too). `links put on saved` (both; LibreOffice reads Tetra's
      slide jumps as its own and writes them back as PowerPoint's); emulator: Plan's words linked to Scores, the show jumped there. Header & footer (slide number,
      date, footer text) — done 17 Oct (office-B session): PowerPoint's dialog (date updated or fixed, slide number, footer,
      Don't show on title slide; Apply / Apply to all), opening with what the slide shows; drawn in the layout's own boxes
      (each read as a slide's own placeholder would be: `Slide.footers`), the date as Words' Date and time's first form
      (`dateForms`); saved as PowerPoint's dt/ftr/sldNum placeholders (slidenum and datetime1 fields) and as LibreOffice
      keeps them (footer-decl, date-time-decl, the page style's display flags; the .odp reader now shows the master's
      boxes so). `header and footer saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions both ways); emulator: on all but the title slide,
      saved, LibreOffice draws them. Seen: the footer's words in LibreOffice's default face (the layout names none). Symbol, Date, Line break —
      done 17 Oct (office-B session): Words' `SymbolDialog` and `DateDialog` (its forms, `dateForms`), and Words' Line break
      (LINE_BREAK, saved as a:br / text:line-break), each put where the typing cursor is — the chosen box's words opened at
      their end, else a new text box; the typing bar has a Line break button. Equation (Words') — done 17 Oct: Words'
      `EquationDialog`; drawn by Words' `MathDrawable` on the slide (sharp at any size); saved as PowerPoint writes one (a14:m
      OMML in a text box, over a picture of it — which is what LibreOffice shows) and as a LibreOffice Math object (MathML,
      `OfficeMath.mathml`) with the picture as its replacement; read back from either with the equation kept (also
      LibreOffice's own a14:m with an EMF fallback), so Edit equation works on a deck's own ones too; the tab is "Equation".
      `an equation put on saved`, `a line break typed saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: x²+1=√y put on,
      saved — LibreOffice draws its picture; a date put in Plan's words. WordArt — done 17 Oct (office-C session): Words' WordArt
      strip (`DesignGalleryStrip` › WordArt: `ART_STYLES`, `ArtBend`; glow offered in .pptx only, as Words offers it in .docx only),
      a look and a bend making it as in Words: Words' "Your text here" in a text box (Insert › Text box's) at Words' size, bold,
      centred, as big as Words makes one (room for the bend); with a box with words chosen, its words take the look instead. Held in
      `Look.effects` (Words' `TextEffects`, in the runs in Word's w14 form, drawn by Words' `EffectSpan`) and `Look.warp`
      (`SlideText.warp`, Words' `TextWarp`, drawn along the bend by Words' `TextBoxDrawable.bent` — pulled out of Words' drawing,
      fingerprint unchanged); saved as PowerPoint writes it (rPr a:ln + a:effectLst glow/outerShdw, bodyPr prstTxWarp fromWordArt)
      and LibreOffice (style:text-outline, fo:text-shadow; bent: a fontwork custom shape, mode and scale "path" as Impress writes
      it, the letters in its fill, the outline its line); read back from both (prstTxWarp; fontwork's fill as the letters' colour).
      `WordArt put on saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: outlined blue, arched, saved — LibreOffice draws the arch
      with its outline. Not drawn (as in Words): a bent WordArt's outline/shadow/glow in Tetra; an .odp fontwork's shadow. Unit suite 416/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none
      failing; Words' fingerprint unchanged (emulator; the tablet not connected). Link (to a web page or to a
      slide); Header & footer (slide number, date, footer text); Symbol; Equation (Words'); WordArt; Icons (later);
      Audio and video (later).
- [~] **Arrange** (on the Selection tab, as PowerPoint's Shape Format): bring forward / send backward / to front /
      to back; align (left, centre, right, top, middle, bottom, to the slide); distribute; group and ungroup; rotate and
      flip; exact size and position; a picture's **crop** (drawn since 780a88d), replace, reset, border; a shape's
      outline width and dash, shadow; Shape styles (Words').
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session), on the chosen item's own tab: Bring forward, Bring to front, Send backward, Send to back
      (`Edit.stack`, a slide's ids from the back: the tree's order in .pptx, the page's in .odp); Align ▾ left/centre/right/top/
      middle/bottom to the slide (Words' Align list); Rotate (Words' `RotateDialog`), Turn left/right, Flip across / up and down
      (`Edit.turns`: xfrm rot/flipH/flipV; .odp: Words' `Arrange.odtTurned` draw:transform, a shape's geometry mirror, a picture's
      style:mirror — a shape mirrored one way turned the other way round in ODF, as LibreOffice converts PowerPoint's); Size and
      position (its own small dialog, in Words' unit cm/inches: Words' size dialog is the picture's in pixels with handles). Found on
      the way: the .odp reader put a turned item at the slide's corner (it ignored draw:transform) and moving a turned one was not
      saved; pictures can now be mirrored (read and drawn); Android's DOM miscounts a child moved within its own parent (taken out
      first). `items turned and reordered saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: a picture turned 30° and saved —
      LibreOffice turns it the same. Not yet: distribute (needs several chosen), group/ungroup, a group turned, the chosen frame
      drawn turned; crop/replace/reset/border; outline width/dash, shadow, Shape styles. Unit 418/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
      Then (office-C session, 17 Oct): Words' `ShapeOptionsDialog` for a slide's shape — Words' Shape styles, fill, outline, outline
      width, size, angle, alt text — applied as one step (only what was changed: a gradient shows there as no fill); Alt text for the
      rest (pictures, charts, tables, text boxes). `Look.lineWidth` (ln w / svg:stroke-width) and `Look.alt`, read back as
      `SlideItem.alt` (PowerPoint's cNvPr descr, LibreOffice's svg:desc) — also the plan's Accessibility item. `shape options and alt
      text saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: a style picked, drawn. A picture's Crop: Words' crop editor (`CornerEditor`,
      Photos' corners, straight cuts) on the whole picture, kept as a crop (`Look.crop`: srcRect / LibreOffice's fo:clip by
      `Slides.picturePt`), what still shows staying where and as big as it was; Reset picture brings the whole back (Words makes a
      new cut picture instead: here PowerPoint's own way is kept). `a picture cropped saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions, Reset);
      emulator: cropped, saved — srcRect in the file. Unit 419/0/7, sweep 349 + 29 none failing (after the disk was cleared: the
      tests' LibreOffice folders had filled /tmp, a 6.8 GB RAM disk — they are now removed: `scratchDir`, and the sweep at once).
      Outline dash and shadow (office-F session, 17 Oct): Words' Shape options dialog gains Dash (Word's list: Solid, Round dot, Square dot,
      Dash, Dash dot, Long dash…) and Shadow (None / Offset: bottom right) — in Words and Slides alike. **Shared piece:** `LineDash`
      (OfficePages.kt: DrawingML's prstDash names ↔ LibreOffice's draw:stroke-dash, drawn as Android dashes) and `ShapePicture.dash/shadow`
      (`dashes()`, `shadowOf()` — Slides' own shape drawing uses them too). Words: .docx a:ln prstDash + effectLst outerShdw (its other
      effects kept), .odt Writer's shape style name `Tetra_20_shape_…_<width>[-dash][-shadow]_<wrap>` with the dash defined in styles.xml;
      Slides: `Look.dash/shadow`, .pptx the same XML, .odp the shape's style (draw:stroke="dash", draw:shadow) and styles.xml's dash. Read
      back from all of them. `a shape's dash and shadow saved` (Words, both formats, LibreOffice's other format of each), `shape options and
      alt text saved` (Slides, both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: arrange.pptx's arrow dashed 3 pt with a shadow, saved —
      LibreOffice draws it so. Seen in passing: LibreOffice draws the rounded box's theme shadow (its style's effectRef), Tetra does not.
      Choosing several, Group / Ungroup, Distribute (office-F session, 17 Oct): Selection › Select all (also Home › Select all and Ctrl+A)
      and Choose several (a tap adds a thing or takes it away; each chosen one outlined); with several chosen the tab is "Arrange" — Group,
      Align ▾ to each other (PowerPoint's Align Selected Objects), Distribute across / down (three or more; the first and last stay), Delete;
      dragging moves them all. A group's tab is "Group", Ungroup first on it. Kept as `Edit.groups` (a group made here: its things' ids;
      a group of a group made here becomes one group of all their things) and `Edit.ungrouped` (a file's group taken apart, each piece by
      its own id: `SlideItem.own`); moved as a group, then taken apart: each keeps where the group put it. Saved as PowerPoint's p:grpSp
      (its box its things', chOff = off) and LibreOffice's draw:g; a file's group unwrapped, each piece's place said on the slide (a group
      in it too). **Shared piece:** Words' Group / Ungroup labels and icon (Words groups two by "tap another"; Slides chooses several, as
      PowerPoint does); Words' Align list. `things grouped and ungrouped saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions, then the saved
      group taken apart); emulator: Select all → Group → dragged → saved, LibreOffice draws it moved; Ungroup; three chosen, Distribute down.
      Not done: an animation on a group made here in an .odp (LibreOffice names a group by xml:id: not written), Copy/Cut of several
      (the first only), a group turned (as before).
- [~] **Slide**: change an existing slide's layout, reset it; sections; a **slide sorter** (a grid, dragged to
      reorder, many at once); copy slides between decks.
      Slide sorter done 17 Oct (office-C session): View › Normal / Slide sorter (PowerPoint's place for it) — every slide small in a
      grid (thumbnails as the sidebar draws them), a tap chooses or lets go (many at once), a slide held and dragged moves there with
      the others chosen (one not chosen moves alone), a double tap opens it; Choose all, Duplicate, Hide/Show, Delete on the chosen.
      Also fixed: Duplicate slide now copies a slide's comments, header & footer, turns and order too. Emulator: slide 4 dragged first.
      Home › Layout (office-C session, 17 Oct): the New slide strip of the deck's layouts, tapped: the chosen slide on that one, its words
      and what is on it kept (`Edit.relayout`; `Deck.relaid` reads the slide again on it — PowerPoint's slideLayout relationship; in an
      .odp the page's master page, whose boxes keep their own places as LibreOffice's do). `a slide's layout changed saved` (.pptx,
      the test .odp, LibreOffice's .odp of the deck with its many masters); emulator: the title slide put on Section Header.
      Sections (office-C session, 17 Oct): Home › Section — a new one from the chosen slide (named), renamed, removed; the name above its
      first slide in the sidebar and in the sorter's and phone's numbers; PowerPoint 2010's p14:sectionLst read and written (slides
      before the first in a "Default Section", as PowerPoint makes it; written again whenever the file has some, so moved or deleted
      slides keep it right). Impress has no sections: the button is not there for an .odp. `sections saved`; LibreOffice opens it.
      Reset slide (office-F session, 17 Oct): Home › Reset (PowerPoint's) — the slide's placeholders back to their layout's place, size and
      look (their own spPr, body settings, list styles and their paragraphs' and letters' looks gone; list levels, links and the words kept);
      Impress has no Reset, so an .odp's placeholders take their master page's place and presentation style, their text styles gone.
      `SlidesEdit.resetSlide` / `SlidesOdp.resetPage`, one XML change used both to show the slide (`Deck.relaid` reads it again, reset) and
      to save it; Tetra's own moves and looks on its placeholders dropped (`Slide.placeholders`); `Edit.reset`. `a slide reset saved` (a
      title moved and made bold, saved; read again, reset: where and as its layout has it, shown, saved, LibreOffice's conversions; both
      formats); emulator: Plan's title moved, Reset — back. Not yet: copy slides between decks.
      Copying slides between decks done 18 Oct (office-F): Home › Reuse slides (PowerPoint's, with its Use destination theme) — another
      .pptx or .odp chosen in the system's picker, its slides shown to tick, Insert puts them after this one on this deck's Blank layout:
      their words as text boxes keeping their letters' looks, alignment, bullets and levels and shrink-to-fit; shapes with their fill
      and words; pictures, tables, charts; background colour; notes (`SlidesReuse`; `slides reused from another deck`, both ways
      between .pptx and .odp, LibreOffice's conversions). The other deck's master decorations stay behind. shortcut: custom outlines,
      gradients, effects, rotation, groups' insides, animations and films not brought (the count left out is said); a bullet as a
      mark and spaces. Emulator: owntable.pptx's slides 2 (a table) and 4 (a chart) put into arrange.pptx.
- [~] **Design**: slide size (16:9, 4:3); format background (colour, gradient, picture); the theme's colour
      variants.
      Colour variants done 17 Oct (office-C session) with the theme's fonts (B's "From Words" Design line): Design › Colours and Fonts
      are Words' strips (`DesignGalleryStrip` Colours / Fonts: `ThemeColors`, `ThemeFonts`), a card shown at once, Cancel/OK, on the
      theme chosen or the deck's own (`SlidesThemes.fromFile`) with `SlideTheme.keep`: only the theme part's colour set and fonts
      change — masters, backgrounds and bands stay (an .odp, which has no theme colours: Fonts only, its colours and backgrounds kept).
      `theme colours and fonts on the deck's own design`; emulator: Green — the theme-coloured box went green.
      Format background (office-C session, 17 Oct): Design › Background — a colour (Words' `Swatches`, `SHAPE_COLOURS`) or Background
      picture (the phone's photo picker, as Insert › Picture), Apply to all, Reset background (as its layout has it); `Edit.backgrounds`,
      drawn stretched over the slide (`Slide.backPicture`); saved as PowerPoint's p:bg (solidFill / blipFill with its media part) and
      as LibreOffice's page style (solid, or bitmap stretched with a draw:fill-image in styles.xml). Read too now: a deck's own picture
      backgrounds (PowerPoint's on a slide, layout or master; LibreOffice's bitmap fill) — before, only colours were drawn.
      `backgrounds saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); LibreOffice draws Tetra's .odp's colour and picture. Not yet: gradient
      backgrounds (read or made), slide size. Unit 424/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing. (Both done since: 396a8f8, 1be3318.)
      Slide size (office-F session, 17 Oct): Design › Slide size ▾ Widescreen (16:9) / Standard (4:3), then PowerPoint's question —
      Maximize (as big as the new size allows, cut at its sides) or Ensure fit (smaller, in the middle, its letters too). `SlidesSize`: a
      copy of the deck with every slide's, layout's and master's things scaled (PowerPoint: p:sldSz, each top-level xfrm, sz and spcPts;
      LibreOffice: the master pages' page layout, every svg place and turn on pages and master pages, fo:font-size), shown and saved from
      as a theme's copy is (`Edit.size`; the theme's and size's copies one, keyed by both). Only from a deck with nothing else changed
      ("Save first": the size moves everything). **Shared piece:** Design › Themes' copy (`themed`). `slide size changed` (both formats,
      both ways, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: arrange.pptx made 16:9, saved — sldSz 12192000 × 6858000. Not: notes pages' size.
      Gradient backgrounds (office-F session, 17 Oct): read — PowerPoint's bgPr gradFill and a theme's background fills (bgRef 1001 on,
      `bgFillStyles`), LibreOffice's gradient page fill (a page's own fill, else its master's) — and drawn under the slide (`Slide.backGradient`,
      the shapes' gradient drawing shared: `Slides.shader`); made in Design › Gradient (a colour: its light tint at the top to it at the foot;
      `Back.to`), saved as PowerPoint's gradFill (lin 90°) and LibreOffice's linear draw:gradient in styles.xml. `a gradient background saved`
      (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions read back as gradients); emulator: the title slide blue, top light. Not: radial gradients made.
      Fixed after (office-F session): a background gradient that cannot be read no longer drops its slide (the sweep found three of the
      user's jamovi decks read as no slides in the JVM, where Android's colours are stubs); on the emulator the jamovi deck's theme gradient
      (Wisp: white to blue-grey) is drawn — before it was not.
- [x] **Draw**: pen and highlighter on a slide while editing (Words' Draw tab), saved as ink in the file.
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session): a Draw tab (PowerPoint's place, after Insert) › Draw on slide opens Words' `DrawDialog` with the slide
      under the pens (it now takes a slide as it takes a page: `slide = width, height, drawing`) — pens, highlighter, eraser, move, undo,
      two fingers to zoom — and the drawing is put on where it was drawn, cut to what was drawn. Saved as Words saves one: a PNG with its
      strokes inside (Word, PowerPoint and LibreOffice show the picture; PowerPoint's own ink part is not written), so the picture's tab
      has Edit drawing (the strokes back in Words' dialog), even after saving and opening again (seen on the emulator with an .odp).
      Also on a picture's tab: Replace (the phone's photo picker; a file's own picture gets a part of its own: `Look.image`).
      `a picture replaced saved` (both formats).
- [x] **Review**: comments (PowerPoint's own, read and written); spelling in the typing field.
      Comments done 17 Oct (office-C session), with Insert › Comment: Words' `NewCommentDialog` (its remembered name), Words'
      `CommentCard`s with their replies (Edit, Reply, Delete — no Resolve: `CommentActions.resolve` now optional, as neither
      PowerPoint's older list nor Impress keeps it) in a pane beside the slide on a tablet, over the slides on a phone; a marker on
      the slide where each stands (tap: the pane at it); Review › New comment, Comments, Previous/Next (round the deck), Reply,
      Delete comment. Read: PowerPoint's older list (+ p15:parentCm replies), PowerPoint 365's threads (replies, resolved), Impress's
      officeooo:annotation; written as PowerPoint's older list (commentAuthors.xml, eighths of a point — what LibreOffice writes and
      PowerPoint 365 shows; a slide's 365 threads become it when its comments are changed) and as Impress's annotations (a reply
      its own annotation: Impress has no threads). `comments saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions; LibreOffice reads a
      comment's place only roughly — its own 5 cm comes back 4.76). Emulator: read, added, saved; phone size too. Spelling: not yet Unit 417/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
      Spelling done 18 Oct (office-F): Review › Spelling — every box's words, slide by slide, checked with Words' dictionaries
      (`WriterSpelling`), each word not in them shown in the shared Excel/PowerPoint-style dialog (`SpellingDialog`, now Tables' too):
      Change (the box's words changed, its looks kept), Ignore, Ignore all. Emulator: "speling" on slide 1 made "spelling".
- [~] **View**: Outline (every slide's words as one list to edit, good on a phone); notes page; editing the slide
      master; grid and guides with snapping; zoom.
      Outline done 17 Oct (office-C session): View › Normal / Outline / Slide sorter; Outline lists every slide's text boxes top to bottom
      (the first as its title, sections named), each typed into in place — one step of Undo a box visited, an empty placeholder shown
      by its hint; a slide's number opens it in Normal. Saved as any typed words (each line over the paragraph it came from).
      Emulator: "Plan and more" typed there. Not shown there: a paragraph's list level (kept in the file).
      Notes page (office-C session, 17 Oct): View › Notes page — the speaker notes under the slide on a tablet or phone, typed there (the
      desktop's notes pane, which a desktop always shows); emulator: slide 1's notes under it.
      Gridlines (office-C session, 17 Oct): View › Gridlines — a faint grid (½ cm, or ¼ in in Words' inches) and the slide's middle lines
      while editing; what is dragged snaps its corner to the grid, or its middle to the slide's middle when near it (PowerPoint's smart
      guide), and a size dragged ends on the grid. Emulator: the picture dragged, centred on the guide.
      Not yet: editing the slide master, zoom.
      Zoom done 18 Oct (office-F): View › Zoom — Fit, 150 %, 200 %, 300 % for the slide being edited (a tablet's layout): the slide in a
      window of the fitted size, moved about by dragging where nothing is chosen; items tapped, dragged and typed in as at Fit (rulers
      shown at Fit only). Emulator: arrange.pptx at 200 %, panned, the flag chosen.
      Editing the slide master — what it is mostly for, done 18 Oct (office-F): a thing put on a slide, Arrange › On every slide, goes
      onto the deck's masters (PowerPoint's slide masters' shape trees, its pictures their own relationships; LibreOffice's master
      pages in styles.xml, the styles it names copied there) and shows under every slide's own things; the master's own shapes (a
      logo, a line) and these are chosen on a slide (on top, or from the Selection pane) with a tab of their own — Only on this slide
      (one put on here), Delete from every slide (each master's copy). `a thing on every slide` (both formats, typed words and their
      colour, LibreOffice's conversions, then taken off). The master's title and body looks change deck-wide through Design's colours
      and fonts. Not yet (later, when asked): a Slide Master view of its own (layouts, the master's placeholders moved or restyled).
      Emulator: "Olive Co-op" on every slide of arrange.pptx, saved, chosen through the Selection pane and taken off every slide. Full run after it: unit 499, 0 failing, 7 skipped; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
- [x] **File**: Find and Replace across slides; export each slide as a picture; Print with handouts; Versions.
      Find and Replace done 17 Oct (office-C session): Words' find bar moved into a shared `FindReplaceBar` (OfficeUi.kt; Words uses it
      as before — checked on the emulator, 1/3 found) and Slides' top bar has it (the search button while editing, Ctrl+F as A planned):
      every slide's words, any case, ‹ › choosing the box a find is in on its slide; Replace and All as one step of Undo, each line
      kept over its paragraph. Emulator: "slides" → "decks" on slides 1 and 2, "Replaced 2". Versions were done in A.
      Export pictures (office-C session, 17 Oct): File › Export pictures — each slide shown (hidden ones left out, as the PDF) a PNG
      1920 px wide, drawn as the slides are, in a folder "<name> slides" beside the deck. Emulator: 4 PNGs, as the slides show.
      Print with handouts (office-C session, 17 Oct): File › Print ▾ Full slides, or handouts as PowerPoint's — 2 or 6 to an A4 page, or 3
      with lines for notes beside each — each slide framed (`Slides.pdf(handouts)`), to Android's print. Emulator: 3-up, 2 pages for 4.
- [~] **Slide show**: rehearse timings; loop until Esc (kiosk); custom shows (later); more animation kinds and an
      animation list (later).
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session): Slide show › Loop until Esc (after the last slide, the first again; kept in the file — PowerPoint's
      presProps showPr loop, LibreOffice's presentation:settings endless; read back from both) and Rehearse timings (the show from the
      first slide with a timer in the corner, slides that go on by themselves waiting; at the end "Keep the new timings?" — each slide's
      time becomes its "after", as Transitions' Next slide sets it). During any show, PowerPoint's keys: N → ↓ Space Enter Page Down on,
      P ← ↑ Backspace Page Up back, B/W/. black, Home/End, a number and Enter to that slide, Esc ends (the plan's PowerPoint list).
      `loop until Esc saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: rehearsed 4 slides, 0:33, kept. Later as planned: custom shows,
      more animation kinds and an animation list. Unit 426/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
- [x] **References** (the user's choices, 17 Oct): Sources (Words' dialogs, Import, Paste, Ask Claude), kept in a .pptx
      in Word's bibliography part, which PowerPoint keeps (an .odp needs its own place: to decide); **live**
      citations, inserted from the typing bar and rewritten when the style or a source changes (PowerPoint has no
      citation fields, so they are found in the words by the deck's sources and style); References slide(s) at the end
      in the style (APA 7, MLA 9, Chicago, Harvard, IEEE), spread over more slides when long, with Update; a **Contents
      slide** after the title slide: each slide's title and number, and in a show a tap on a title goes there
      (`ppaction://hlinksldjump`); Update after slides move.
      Sources and citations done 17 Oct (office-C session): a References tab (Words' place, before Review) — Sources (Words'
      `SourcesDialog`/`SourceDialog`, Import a Tetra sources file, Paste Claude's answer, Ask Claude — `SourcesImport`, tags by
      `Citations.tagFor`), Style ▾ (Words' `CiteStyle`: APA 7, MLA 9, Chicago, Harvard), Insert citation (Words' `CitationDialog`, put in
      where one types). Kept in a .pptx in Word's bibliography part by Words' `WordSources` (customXml, as PowerPoint keeps it); in an
      .odp in meta.xml's user-defined properties in Word's form ("Tetra sources", "Tetra citation style" — **my choice, see Waiting on
      the user**; the user, 17 Oct: "Keep the .odp's sources in meta.xml"), which LibreOffice keeps when it saves. Live: changing the style or a source writes every citation in the slides
      again (found by the sources' citations in the old style). `sources saved` (both; LibreOffice's own save of the .odp keeps them);
      emulator: "(Smith)" (MLA) became "(Smith, 2020)" when the style was made APA. Shortcuts: one source and no page a citation
      (Words' fields hold more), IEEE not offered (its numbers follow the order of citing).
      References slide and Contents slide (office-C session, 17 Oct): References › References slide puts the list in the deck's style at
      its end (Words' `CiteStyle.sorted`/`entry`: italic titles kept), on the deck's Title Only layout under the style's heading (Works
      Cited, References…), over more slides when long ("(continued)", laid out by Words' engine to fit); Contents slide puts each slide's
      title and number after the first slide, each title a link to its slide (PowerPoint's hlinksldjump, LibreOffice's #page — a tap in a
      show goes there). Pressed again, each replaces its old slides (Update — found by their titles, so after reopening too). Both are
      text boxes whose words keep looks of their own (`Added.runs`, a hanging indent: a:r rPr i / hlinkClick, LibreOffice's spans and
      text:a). `words with their own looks put on saved` (both); emulator: Works Cited and Contents made, saved — LibreOffice draws the
      italics and the links. Unit 428/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
- [x] Accessibility: alt text for pictures (with Arrange's Shape options, office-C session 17 Oct).

**From PowerPoint** (checked online 17 Oct: PowerPoint's ribbon — Home, Insert, Draw, Design, Transitions, Animations,
Slide Show, Record, Review, View — and Microsoft's page comparing PowerPoint on each platform); what is not listed above:
- [ ] (office-C session, 17 Oct: none of the user's 25 .pptx and 4 .odp decks has SmartArt, video or audio, and there is no PowerPoint here
      to make one to check against — left for when such a deck comes; equations and hidden slides are done)
      **Opening other people's decks well** (most important — a deck that looks wrong can't be presented): **SmartArt**
      drawn from the drawing the file saves with it (check: not found in Slides' code); a deck's **video and audio
      played** in the show (today neither is); its embedded fonts used; equations drawn (Word's OMML, as Words');
      hidden slides skipped in the show; an empty placeholder shows "Click to add title/text" and typing fills it.
- [x] **Selection pane**: every object on the slide in a list — choose one under another, hide or show it, rename it,
      reorder by dragging (the only way to reach a covered object on a tablet).
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session): Home › Selection pane (and beside Arrange's order buttons) — the slide's things, front first, each
      by its name (else what it is) with its words under it; tapped, it is chosen (one under another too); the eye hides or shows it (not
      drawn, not tappable on the slide, skipped in the show); rename in place; ↑ ↓ Bring forward / Send backward (`restack`, Edit.stack —
      arrows, not dragging: a list's drag fights the dialog's scroll on a phone). Saved as PowerPoint's cNvPr name / hidden="1" and
      LibreOffice's draw:name / drawooo:display="none"; read back from both (`SlideItem.name`, `hidden`; `Look.name`, `Look.hide`).
      **Shared piece:** none of Words' (Words has no selection pane); the Animation pane's list. `a thing named and hidden saved`
      (a shape: both kept by LibreOffice's conversions; on a placeholder LibreOffice 26.2 loses hidden both ways and its .pptx renames it).
- [~] **Picture**: picture styles (frame, shadow, rounded corners — the tablet app has these); transparency; colour
      and brightness; compress pictures; remove background (later).
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session): the picture's tab › Picture styles (Plain, White frame, Black frame, Shadow, Rounded, Rounded with
      shadow) and Transparency (None, 15–80 %). `PictureLook` (alpha, outline, shadow, rounded) read from both formats and drawn (a soft
      shadow under it, corners clipped, the outline round it); saved as PowerPoint's blip alphaModFix, spPr ln, effectLst outerShdw and
      prstGeom roundRect, and LibreOffice's draw:image-opacity, stroke and shadow (an .odp keeps no rounded picture). **Shared piece:**
      none of Words' (Words' Picture tab has neither yet — Words should get the same `PictureLook` when it does). `a picture's style and
      transparency saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions keep them); emulator: rounded with shadow at 30 %. Not yet: colour and
      brightness, compress pictures; a strip of cards for the styles (a menu for now).
      18 Oct (office-F): colour, brightness and contrast — later: none of the user's 29 decks uses them (their pictures' only
      setting is transparency, which is done); compress pictures later too.
- [x] **Shapes**: text effects (shadow, outline, glow) and character spacing; merge shapes (union, combine,
      intersect, subtract — later); edit points (later).
      Text effects done 18 Oct (office-F): Home › Text effects on any box's words — Outline, Shadow, Glow, each on or off (WordArt's,
      already read and written both ways; an .odp has no glow, so none offered). Emulator: arrange.pptx's red words shadowed and glowing.
      Character spacing: later — Words has none either; the shared engine lays letters out without it, so it comes to all three at once.
      Character spacing done 18 Oct (office-F): in the shared engine (`LetterLooks.spacing`, drawn by `LetterLooks.Spaced` only on a run
      that has some — Words' fingerprint unchanged); Words' Home › Spacing and Slides' Home › Spacing (Very tight −1.5 pt … Very loose
      +3 pt), in Word's w:spacing, LibreOffice's fo:letter-spacing and PowerPoint's spc — read, shown in the editor and on the pages,
      written (`CharacterSpacingTest`: Words' .docx and .odt, Slides' .pptx and .odp, LibreOffice's conversions each way). Tables: none
      — Excel's and Calc's cells have no character spacing. Emulator: Reading list's "Greek" very loose, saved, on the page.
- [x] **Transitions**: duration; sound (later); advance on click and/or after a time set here (the file's `advTm`
      is played today, not set); **Morph** (later: the most used modern transition).
      Found done 18 Oct (office-F): Transitions › Options — Fast / Medium / Slow, and Next slide: On click, After 3 / 5 / 10 / 20 s.
- [~] **Animations**: start on click / with previous / after previous; duration and delay; entrance, emphasis and
      exit kinds; the animation list (pane) to reorder; animation painter; motion paths and triggers (later).
      Found 17 Oct (office-D session): start, duration (Fast/Medium/Slow), delay, the kinds and Earlier/Later were already in Options and
      Effect. Added: **Animation pane** (the slide's effects in order — click number, what, to what, when, how long; tap to choose, ↑ ↓,
      take away) and **Animation painter** (the chosen thing's effects put on the next thing chosen, in place of its own). **Shared
      piece:** none of Words' (Words has no animations); the format painter's way of working. Emulator: Fade painted from the title onto
      the subtitle, both in the pane. Not yet: motion paths and triggers (later).
- [x] **Slide show**: go to a slide by number or from a grid during the show; keyboard keys as PowerPoint's (N/P,
      arrows, B/W screen, number + Enter, Esc); keep or discard the pen's ink at the end, saved into the deck;
      set-up options (loop, without animations, use timings or not); subtitles (later).
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session): a number + Enter and PowerPoint's keys (with Loop until Esc, B › Slide show above); at the end of a
      show drawn on with the pen (while editing), "Keep your ink?" — kept, each slide's strokes become a drawing on it where they were
      (Words' drawing picture, red as the pen, Edit drawing draws on). Emulator: a line under the subtitle, kept. Not yet: a grid to go to
      a slide during the show, without animations, use timings or not; subtitles later.
      A grid to go to a slide during the show done 18 Oct (office-F): the show's tools › All slides (PowerPoint's See All Slides) —
      every slide shown, the one on screen marked, one tapped goes there (the second screen follows). Emulator: slide 3 from the grid.
      Without animation and Use timings done 18 Oct (office-F): Slide show › Without animation (each slide whole at once) and Use timings
      (off: on a click only), kept in the file as Loop is — PowerPoint's showPr showAnimation / useTimings, LibreOffice's settings
      animations="disabled" / force-manual (`shown without animation and timings`; LibreOffice carries Use timings across, not
      Without animation). Emulator: both on the Slide show tab. Subtitles: later.
- [ ] **Record** (later): record narration and timings per slide; export the deck as a video.
- [x] **View**: reading view; ruler; notes and handout masters (later); grayscale preview (later).
      Done 18 Oct (office-F): View › Ruler (Words' HorizontalRuler and VerticalRuler round the slide being edited, in Words' unit from
      its top left; a tablet's layout, as Words shows its rulers) and Reading view (the show from the chosen slide — on a phone or
      tablet the screen is its window). Emulator: a 4:3 slide's 25.4 × 19.05 cm; slide 4 shown.
- [x] **File**: Save as template (.potx, into Tetra's Templates folder, where Design › Themes finds it); Save as
      .odp / .pptx; remove notes and comments before sharing (Inspect); password protection (later).
      Template and Inspect done 17 Oct (office-C session, with From Words' File above). Saving as the other format done 18 Oct
      (office-F): File › Save as has PowerPoint / LibreOffice; the other one rebuilds the deck on Tetra's blank of that kind (assets
      blank.pptx, and blank.odp — LibreOffice's conversion of it), sized as the deck, every slide as Reuse slides brings one plus its
      master's and layout's decorations, background picture, transition, hidden mark and notes (`SlidesReuse.convert`); Slides goes
      on with the new file. `saved as the other format` (both ways, LibreOffice's conversions); the deck sweep now also saves each of
      the 29 as the other format (all slides, LibreOffice's pages the same). Left behind (said in the dialog): animations, films, a
      group's insides; placeholders become text boxes on a plain theme. Emulator: arrange.pptx → .odp → .pptx, both read back.
- [x] **Text**: right-to-left text and text direction (vertical); highlight (planned in Home above).
      Done 18 Oct (office-F): a shape's Text direction — Horizontal, Rotate all text 90°, 270° (PowerPoint's bodyPr vert / vert270;
      LibreOffice's loext:writing-mode tb-rl90 / bt-lr, on the shape's style and its paragraphs', as LibreOffice writes them), read
      and drawn turned (`SlideText.vert`). `text turned 90 and 270 degrees` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions; its PDF of
      ours shows them turned). Emulator: arrange.pptx's rounded box turned. Highlight: on Home already. Right-to-left: later —
      Tetra's languages are Greek and English.
- [~] **Insert**: Zoom (summary and slide zoom — later); action buttons (as Link to a slide); photo album (later).
      Object links with a zoom done 17 Oct (office-C session; the user: "link from one page to the next … maps with images that zoom in
      … linking slides and objects together", "click to jump slides or objects, textboxes, zoom in and out effects"): Insert › Link with
      a picture or shape (or chart) chosen links the object itself — to a slide, a web page, or "The slide it came from" (PowerPoint's
      Last Slide Viewed; .pptx only, LibreOffice has none) — the shared `LinkDialog` gaining that choice. Saved as PowerPoint's click
      action on the object (cNvPr hlinkClick, hlinksldjump / lastslideviewed) and LibreOffice's (office:event-listeners, "show" to the
      page); read back from both (`SlideItem.link`). In a show a tap on it (or on a box with linked words) jumps, the new slide growing
      out of what was tapped; going back it shrinks back into it — Tetra's own zoom (PowerPoint and LibreOffice jump plainly).
      `a picture linked to a slide saved` (both, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: the flag zoomed into Scores, the chart back out.
      Unit 429/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing. Not yet: PowerPoint's Zoom objects (a slide's picture that is itself the link), photo album.
- [~] **Video** (the user, 17 Oct: "Video import, there is no online or offline option on any of the applets"): Insert › Video in
      Slides — offline (a video from the phone, kept in the deck, played in the show: PowerPoint's p:pic videoFile + p14:media, Impress's
      draw:plugin) and online (a YouTube or web address kept as a link with its picture, opened when tapped in the show: PowerPoint's
      Online Video); then Words (Word's Online Video). Excel has none, so Tables not.
      Slides done 17 Oct (office-C session): Insert › Video ▾ From this phone (Android's picker; the film copied, its picture a frame a
      second in) or Online video (an address; YouTube's own picture fetched, else a dark one naming the site). Drawn as its picture with a
      play mark; its tab is "Video" with Play. In a show a tap plays it over the slides (Android's player; a film in the file is taken out
      of it to play) or opens an online one in its app. Saved as PowerPoint's Insert › Video makes one (p:pic with a:videoFile, p14:media
      embedding the film in ppt/media, a tap playing it) and as Impress's (draw:plugin, the film in the package's Media/, its picture
      beside); online ones as a linked address in both. Read back from both (`SlideItem.media`); LibreOffice keeps both films in its
      conversions. `videos put on saved`; emulator: a 4-second film put on, saved, reopened and played in the show; a YouTube address
      put on with its picture. Unit 430/0/7; sweep 349 + 29, none failing. Not yet: Words' Online Video, sound (audio), a film's start/end.
      Words done 17 Oct (office-D session; the user: "Word loads it in word, the same with offline from a path and then pass it to slides",
      "resize rotate line an image like a html embedding a frame"): Insert › Video in Words — Online video and From this phone, in .docx
      and .odt. The video is a picture (its tab "Video": Play, Size, Crop, Wrap text, turn — as an image's), with a play mark; Play or a
      tap on it in the pages plays it **in its own frame** where it stands (its size and turn): a film in Android's player, an online one
      in YouTube's own player in a web frame (an iframe, as Word plays its Online Video) — Slides now does the same, in editing and in the
      show (no more going out to YouTube's app). Saved as Word's Online Video (wp15:webVideoPr with its player, a click to the address)
      and LibreOffice's media frame (draw:plugin: the address, or the film in Media/); a film from the phone in a .docx is kept in
      word/media beside its picture (PowerPoint's media relationship, named in Tetra's own ext — Word has no such video and shows the
      picture). Read back from all of these, and from LibreOffice's copy of Word's Online Video (a picture linked to the address).
      **Shared piece:** OfficeVideo.kt (`OfficeVideo.poster`/`fromPhone`/`film`/`mark`, `VideoFrame`, `VideoButton`), moved out of
      Slides; `DocImage.film`, `PictureXml.video`; `LaidPage.videoAt`. `a video put in Words is saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's
      conversions); emulator: both kinds in a .docx and an .odt, saved, played on the pages and in Slides' show; LibreOffice draws them.
      LibreOffice limit: it writes its own media frame into a .docx as an empty shape. Not yet: the film on a show's second screen.
      Show taps (the user, 17 Oct: a tap going forward "overlaps with actions like play video"; asked, chose "hold while playing"): a tap
      still goes through the slide's clicks and then the next slide (PowerPoint's way), a tap on a video or link plays or follows it, and
      now while a video plays a tap beside it only stops it — the next tap goes on; swipes and keys go on at once. Emulator: checked.
      Sound done 18 Oct (office-F): Slides › Insert › Audio (PowerPoint's Audio on My PC) — a sound from the phone (mp3, m4a, wav, ogg,
      aac, flac) as a speaker in the slide's middle, its tab "Audio" with Play, played in its frame when tapped in a show; saved as
      PowerPoint's (p:pic with a:audioFile and p14:media, the audio relationship) and Impress's (draw:plugin with the sound's type —
      audio/x-wav for a WAV, LibreOffice's name: with audio/wav its .pptx leaves the sound out). `a sound put on saved` (both formats,
      LibreOffice's conversions). Emulator: a tone picked from Music, saved, read back as a sound, played. Online video was done 17 Oct.
      A film's start and end done 18 Oct (office-F): the Video tab's Trim (PowerPoint's Trim Video) — a range over the film's length,
      to a tenth of a second; it plays from that start and stops at that end, editing and in a show (the player seeks to the very frame,
      not the keyframe before it). Kept as PowerPoint's p14:trim in the film's p14:media (ms left out at the start and at the end), on a
      film just put on or one already in the file; read back. Only in a .pptx: LibreOffice has no trim (the button is not shown on an
      .odp, nor for online videos). `a film trimmed`. Emulator: an 8-second counting film trimmed to 3–6 s, saved, reopened, played 3→6.
- Not planned: Designer and Copilot (need Microsoft's cloud), co-authoring and @mentions (no cloud), online pictures
  (no network services), Cameo, translate, compare presentations. (YouTube: now wanted, see Video above.)

**From Words** (asked 17 Oct: "transfer the rest of the features from Words to Slides" — Slides' Insert had only
Picture, Shape and Table). Each Words button checked against what a slide can hold; what is already listed above is not
repeated. Words' code is reused wherever it fits (its dialogs, strips, pickers).
- [~] **Selection** (Slides has none of these): Cut, Copy, Paste a shape, picture or table (on another slide, in
      another deck); Paste text only; Select all on the slide; Copy formatting / Paste formatting.
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session): a Selection tab first whenever something is chosen (A's rule), Words' buttons in Words' order — Cut,
      Copy, Paste (what was put on, a picture, a shape, and now a box of the file's with words, pasted as a text box keeping its words'
      size, bold, italic, colour and links), Paste text only (the clipboard's words into the chosen box, else a new text box: `putWords`),
      Copy formatting / Paste formatting (the look kept until replaced, as Words'; Home's Format painter now reads the same `lookOf`).
      **Shared piece:** Words' Selection tab (labels, icons, order), Slides' own copy/paste underneath. Emulator: title copied and pasted,
      its look pasted on the subtitle. Not yet: Select all (needs choosing several things at once — with Group below); a pasted box's
      paragraph alignment (`Added.runs` keeps letters only); pasting into another deck works within one Slides session only.
      Select all done (office-F session, 17 Oct, with Arrange's Group above).
- [~] **Home** (with the runs above): superscript and subscript; Smaller / Bigger text; Aa (change case); multilevel
      lists; Words' paragraph page (More…: indents, spacing before and after, line spacing exactly); a text box's
      border and shading (as Words' Borders, written as the shape's line and fill).
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session): X² and X₂ (Words' buttons) on the box's words — `Look.script`, saved as PowerPoint's baseline 30000 /
      −25000 and LibreOffice's text-position super/sub 58 %, read back from both and LibreOffice's conversions; Aa (Words' Change case:
      `WriterBridge.inCase`, the four cases) on the box's lines, each letter keeping its look as typed words do (one step of Undo); copied
      looks carry X²/X₂ too. Smaller / Bigger: Words has none beyond its − size + stepper, which Slides already has. **Shared piece:**
      Words' X²/X₂ and Aa (`WriterBridge.Case`, `inCase`). `Home's looks on a box saved` (superscript added); emulator: a title made
      UPPERCASE and raised. Not yet: a text box's borders and shading.
      Found done 18 Oct (office-F): a text box's Fill and Border (and Shape options' width, dash, shadow) on its tab.
      Multilevel list and Paragraph (office-F session, 17 Oct): Home › Multilevel opens Words' Multilevel list strip (`DesignGalleryStrip`
      › Lists, `LIST_SCHEMES`) — each paragraph numbered in its level's form (1. a. i., I. A. 1., i. a. 1.; Word's "1. 1.1." shows each
      level's own 1. 2., as PowerPoint has no such numbers) — and Home › Paragraph opens Words' paragraph page (`ParagraphDialog`: before
      and after, line spacing or exactly, indents) on all the box's paragraphs. `Look.scheme`/`Look.para`; numbers' forms read from
      PowerPoint's buAutoNum type and LibreOffice's num-format and counted per level (`SlideBullet.num`, `SlideBullet.form/text`: a b … aa,
      i ii iii iv …); saved as PowerPoint's buAutoNum per paragraph's lvl and pPr lnSpc/spcBef/spcAft/marL/marR/indent, and LibreOffice's
      list style's num-format per level and paragraph style fo:margin-*/line-height/text-indent (in an .odp a list paragraph's margin is
      on top of its list's indent, LibreOffice's way). **Shared pieces:** Words' Lists strip and `ParagraphDialog`. `a multilevel list and a
      paragraph look saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: Plan's body I. A. B. II. A. Seen in passing (Words' engine,
      not this item): a number wider than its hang goes to the next half-inch stop (PowerPoint's default tab is the master's defTabSz, 1 in).
      List level in and out per paragraph: still with the rich typing editor (later).
- [~] **Insert**: **Drop cap** — (office-engine session, 17 Oct: the strip and Raised done, Slides' Dropped next) PowerPoint and Impress have none, so it is either a raised cap (the first letter a
      bigger run of its own, which every app shows) or a dropped one (the letter in its own box, the paragraph's first
      lines indented beside it: looks right everywhere but doesn't reflow). **The user, 17 Oct:** "these are options,
      not one choice: make a modal and add the options", then "it could also be a ribbon of cards with an example
      each, like Words has for pages". So: a strip of cards in the ribbon's place (as Page numbers'), one per kind —
      None, Dropped, Raised — each a small paragraph showing it; a More… card opening the dialog with the finer
      settings (lines to drop, distance from the text, a preview). Words' own Drop cap made the same if it is not
      already, so the two match (one shared piece).
      Done 17 Oct: one strip (`DesignGalleryStrip` › `DesignGallery.DropCap`, a card a kind — `DropKind` None, Dropped,
      In margin, Raised — each a small paragraph showing it, then More…) with a "Lines − n +" setting on it (the user:
      as Word's "Lines to drop" 1–10, LibreOffice's "Lines" 2–9; Tetra 2–10, 3 first). Words: its dropdown gone for the
      strip (None, Dropped, In margin in a .docx), the pages shown while choosing, More… its own dialog. Slides: None and
      Raised (the first letter a run of its own, lines × the words' size, saved as a bigger run in .pptx and .odp,
      made plain again by None), More… Words' dialog in a raised form (lines, the letter's face and colour). Found in
      passing: a Words drop cap in a paragraph whose second line holds a picture came out huge (fixed: a line's step no
      more than the first line). `a raised first letter saved` (.pptx, .odp, LibreOffice's conversions). Slides' Dropped
      (office-B session, 17 Oct): the letter in a text box of its own (Insert › Text box's), N lines tall, its capital from the first
      line's capitals to line N's foot, beside the paragraph; the paragraph split where Words' engine breaks its line N
      (`SlidesText.drop`), the lines before standing in by the letter's width (`Look.drop`: marL / fo:margin-left, no space after),
      the rest under them (no space before); each letter's look kept (`relook` now finds the words inside what was there). Shared
      pieces: the strip (`DesignGalleryStrip`), `DropCapDialog` (Slides: None, Dropped, Raised; distance for Dropped), the text box,
      Words' layout. `a dropped first letter saved` (.pptx, .odp, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: 3 and 4 lines on a typed
      paragraph, saved, LibreOffice draws it the same (its own line breaks: its font). Doesn't reflow (as planned): None
      afterwards only un-raises; the letter box is deleted as any box. Date and time
      (fixed, or a field that updates, as PowerPoint's); line break inside a paragraph; Comment; a link's Edit
      (beside Link above). Slide numbers come with Header & footer.
- [x] **Picture / Shape** (Words' Picture tab): Add text to a shape, Edit text; Shape options (fill and outline
      colour, besides width and dash above); Save picture as; Edit data on a chart, Edit equation, Edit drawing.
      Already there (found 18 Oct, office-F): Edit text, Fill / Border / Text colour, Edit equation, Edit drawing, Edit data on a chart
      put on here. Add text done 18 Oct (office-F): a deck's shape with no words gets them (typed as a box's are): in a .pptx a text
      body of its own, centred as PowerPoint's (`words added to a shape that had none`); in an .odp a paragraph in the shape.
      Emulator: arrange.pptx's arrow says "Next", LibreOffice reads it there.
      Save picture as done 18 Oct (office-F): Words' own, now shared (`savePictureToPhone`: into Pictures/Tetra, its kind told by its
      first bytes) — on a picture's tab in Slides and Tables. Emulator: arrange.pptx's flag saved as a PNG (Tables' not tried there).
      Edit data on the deck's own chart done 18 Oct (office-F): Words' chart editor on its numbers, then put on in its place as Slides'
      own chart (as a deck's equation is). shortcut: the file's own styling of the chart not kept, and its old part stays in the
      package unreferenced. Emulator: arrange.pptx's bar chart made a line chart; LibreOffice's PDF of it shows the line.
- [~] **Table** tab when a table is chosen (Words'): row above / below, column left / right, delete row, column,
      table; merge and split cells; borders and shading; table styles; Make chart from the table.
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session), for a table put on in Slides: Make chart (Words' `OfficeCharts.fromTable`: the first row names the
      series, the first column the categories, into Words' chart editor), Row above / below, Column left / right (round the cell last
      tapped; the table a row taller, a column wider — keeping its width when it would leave the slide), Delete row, column, table; its
      fill and words' colour as before. **Shared piece:** Words' Table tab (its labels, icons and order) and `fromTable`; the rows and
      columns are `SlidesEdit.rowAdded/columnAdded/rowTaken/columnTaken` on the table's cells. `a table's rows and columns`; emulator:
      2×2 made 3×3, saved — LibreOffice opens it. Not yet: merge and split, borders, table styles.
      18 Oct (office-F): table styles are there as the Fill colour's banded look (PowerPoint's Medium Style 2 in that colour, read
      from a deck's own styles too). Merge and split, cell borders: later — they need spans through the reader, the drawing and
      both writers, and the user's decks have one table in all, with none.
      A deck's own tables (office-F session, 17 Oct): the same Table tab on a table that came with the file — a second tap chooses the cell
      the rows and columns go round; Make chart from its words. Kept as `Edit.tables` (rows and columns added or taken, in order;
      `SlidesEdit.tabled` shows them), saved into the file's own table: PowerPoint's a:tbl (a gridCol and each row's a:tc copied with no
      words, their ids dropped; a:tr likewise; the frame grown), LibreOffice's table:table (repeated columns and cells split first; a
      copied column keeps its width style). **Shared piece:** Words' Table tab (labels, icons, order) and `OfficeCharts.fromTable`.
      `a deck's own table's rows and columns saved` (a table saved, read as the file's, a row and column added and a row taken; both
      formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: owntable.pptx, Row below and Column right. Not: merged cells (copied unmerged).
- [x] **Layout** for a text box: inner margins; columns in a text box (PowerPoint's `numCol`); no wrap.
      Done 17 Oct (office-D session): the chosen box's tab › Layout (PowerPoint's Format Shape › Text Box): inner margins in Words' unit,
      "Wrap the words in the box", Columns 1–6 and the room between them. Saved as PowerPoint's bodyPr lIns…bIns, wrap, numCol/spcCol and
      LibreOffice's fo:padding-*, fo:wrap-option, style:columns; read back from both (an .odp's columns and no-wrap were not read before).
      Columns are drawn by the shared engine: the words laid a column wide, going on into the next where the box's room ends
      (`SlidesText.columns`, splitting Words' laid pieces by line). **Shared piece:** Words' engine (`OfficePages.stack`, `Block`) and
      `WriterUnits`. `a box's layout saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions keep all of it); emulator: a box in two columns.
- [x] **Design**: the theme's fonts (Words' Fonts), besides its colours above (office-C session, 17 Oct, with B › Design).
- [x] **Review**: Read aloud (a slide's words, or its notes), as Words'.
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session): Review › Read aloud — Words' `ReadAloud` (Android's speech, each paragraph in its own language)
      reads the slides' words from the chosen slide on, box by box top to bottom, the slides following it; Read the notes reads the
      speaker notes instead; Words' `ReadAloudBar` (what is read, Stop) in the top bar meanwhile. Emulator: read, the bar showed the line.
- [x] **File**: AutoSave, Save a copy, Save as, Rename (as Words', beside A's list).
      Done 17 Oct (office-C session): File › Save a copy ("name (copy)" beside it, the file and its edits left as they are), AutoSave
      (Words' own setting, one for both; in Slides it saves as the app goes to the background, because a save reads the deck again and
      would take Undo away while one works), Save as (a name beside it, Slides going on with the new file), Rename (the file, its
      recovery draft and versions, as Words renames). With PowerPoint's list below: Save as template (.potx into Tetra's Templates, which
      Design › Themes and New presentation offer; a .pptx only) and Inspect (speaker notes and comments taken out before sharing, Undo
      brings them back). Emulator: a .potx made in Templates; Save as went on with "sorter (18) (2).pptx".
- [x] **While typing**: Words' keyboard bar (bold, italic, underline, highlight, voice typing) over the keyboard.
      Done 18 Oct (office-F): Words' KeyboardBar and rememberDictation over a text box's typing panel, on tablet and phone
      (the ribbon is hidden while typing on both); Bold, Italic, Underline, highlight on the box as Home's, voice typing in
      at the cursor (Insert's putWords), ⋯ puts the words in and brings the ribbon back. Emulator: arrange.pptx's subtitle bold.
- Not for slides: page breaks, blank page, watermark, page borders, line numbers, hyphenation, footnotes and
  endnotes, captions and cross-references, track changes, content controls, style sets (PowerPoint has none of these).

### C. Tables — what Excel and Calc have that Tables lacks
- [x] **Home**: merge and centre (and unmerge); column width and row height (typed, and AutoFit to the contents);
      hide and unhide rows, columns and sheets; insert and delete cells shifting the rest; Fill down and right; cell
      styles; **Format as table** (make an Excel Table) — done; **conditional formatting** made here — done;
      Find and **Replace**; Format painter.
      Replace done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Tables' own find (all sheets, Go To) gets Words' replace row (`ReplaceRow`, moved out of
      `FindReplaceBar` and shared) while editing — Replace (the cell shown) and All, in each found cell's words or formula, any case
      (`SheetInput.replaced`), one step of Undo, recalculated. `words replaced in a cell`; emulator: alpha → Gamma, "Replaced 1".
      Merge & centre and Unmerge done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Home › Merge & centre with several cells chosen (Excel's: only the top
      left keeps what it holds, centred), Unmerge with a merged one chosen — a change to the file (`SheetMerge`: Excel's mergeCells in the
      schema's place, LibreOffice's spanned cell over covered ones, repeated rows and cells cut first), as inserting rows is (`fileStep`;
      the centring a second step of Undo). `cells merged and unmerged` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: A4 unmerged,
      A4:C4 merged and centred.
      Format painter, Fill down / right done (office-F session, 17 Oct): the Selection tab gets Words' Copy formatting / Paste formatting
      (a cell's look onto all the cells chosen — a range, which a one-tap painter cannot take on a phone); Home › Fill down / Fill right
      with several rows or columns chosen (the fill handle's own `fillCells`: series and formulas carried as the handle carries them).
      Insert › Symbol: Words' `SymbolDialog`, put in where one types in the cell (typing begun with its words). Emulator: A1's yellow on
      A7:B7; € in C9.
      Column width and row height, Hide and Unhide done (office-F session, 17 Oct): a column's or row's tab (its letter or number tapped)
      › Width / Height (typed in Words' unit, cm or inches), AutoFit (its longest words, its biggest letters), Hide, and Unhide when one
      beside it is hidden — a change to the file (`SheetSizes`: Excel's `<cols>` runs cut and changed, a row's ht/customHeight/hidden, a
      row made where the sheet has none; LibreOffice's column and row styles and table:visibility, repeated ones cut first). Fixed on the
      way: two file changes started together (the second from the file without the first) — now one at a time. `widths heights and hidden
      saved` (both formats; LibreOffice reads Excel's width in characters a few % wider — its own character); emulator: C made 4 cm, hidden,
      shown again. Hiding and showing sheets (office-F session, 17 Oct): a sheet's tab › Hide (while another is shown) and Unhide ▾ the
      hidden ones (`SheetVisibility`: Excel's state="hidden", the open tab moved off it; LibreOffice's table style table:display).
      `a sheet hidden and shown` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: Second hidden, shown again.
      Format as table done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Home › Format as table with the cells chosen (headings in the first row) —
      Excel's gallery (Medium 1–7, Light 8–14) drawn in the workbook's own theme colours (`Workbook.theme`); .xlsx: Excel's table part
      (`SheetTables.xlsx`: unique id and name, headings made its column names as Excel makes them — an empty one "Column n", a repeat
      numbered on, typed into the cells first —, its own filter, a sheet filter over it taken away; a table already there or merged
      cells refused), drawn by the reader's built-in styles (moved to `SheetTables.builtIn`/`lay`); .ods (LibreOffice has no table
      styles): the same looks put on the cells, as its AutoFormat does. `a table made` (LibreOffice reads it as a database range);
      emulator: A1:D3 of a file whose accent 1 is green, Medium 3 saved. Not yet: Table Design (total row, banded columns, resize).
      Conditional formatting made here (office-F session, 18 Oct): Home › Conditional formatting — Excel's menu: Greater than, Less than,
      Between, Equal to, Text that contains, Duplicate values (each asking its value(s) and one of Excel's three looks), Top 10, Above
      average, Data bars, Colour scale (at once), Clear rules (`SheetConditional`: Excel's conditionalFormatting with a dxf, put first
      as Excel puts a new rule; LibreOffice's calcext:conditional-format with a cell style of its own, named as it shows it — it finds
      a condition's style by that name). A value with a decimal comma taken as a number. `conditional formatting made and cleared`
      (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions both ways); emulator: B2:B5 of an .ods > 1000 in light red. shortcut: Clear rules takes
      a rule partly over the cells away whole. Not yet: icon sets, Manage rules.
- [x] **Insert**: **Chart from the chosen cells** (Words' chart editor, the series from the cells); picture; shape
      and text box; link; **notes and comments** (they are only shown today); symbol; a checkbox in a cell; a drop-down
      (data validation list); sparklines (later); PivotTable (later).
      A checkbox in a cell: later (18 Oct, office-F) — it is Excel 365's alone (a cell look's feature property bag; older Excel
      shows TRUE/FALSE, LibreOffice nothing); a drop-down list of Yes/No does the job meanwhile.
      Chart done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Insert › Chart with cells chosen — Words' `OfficeCharts.fromTable` makes the series from them,
      Words' `ChartDialog` edits it, then it goes on the sheet to the right of the cells, Excel's default 8 × 15 cells (`SheetChart`:
      Words' `ChartWriter` part in the sheet's drawing, a two-cell anchor — a new drawing made when the sheet has none —, or LibreOffice's
      chart object in the cell). shortcut: the chart holds its own numbers (not linked to the cells). `a chart put on a sheet` (both
      formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: A1:B3 charted.
      Link done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Insert › Link — Words' shared `LinkDialog` (now naming its places: "Sheet in this workbook"),
      a web page or another sheet's A1, the words to show typed into the cell; Excel's hyperlink (an outside relationship, or a location)
      or LibreOffice's text:a round the cell's words (`SheetLinks`, a change to the file); Remove link. `links on cells saved` (both
      formats, LibreOffice's conversions, one taken away); emulator: A2 linked to the second sheet.
      Notes done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Insert › Note / Edit note / Delete note — Words' `NewCommentDialog` (its remembered name; a
      label of its own: "Note") — saved as Excel's comments part with the VML note shape Excel draws it by (both made when the sheet has
      none) and LibreOffice's office:annotation in the cell (`SheetNotes`, a change to the file). `notes made and taken away` (both
      formats, LibreOffice's conversions; a sheet with notes and one without); emulator: a note on C3. Not yet: threaded comments.
      Picture and Text box done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Insert › Picture (Words' picker and `preparePicture`, now shared; at most
      300 pt wide) and Text box (its words asked; 2 × 0.8 in) at the chosen cell — Excel's pic and txBox shapes in the sheet's drawing,
      LibreOffice's frame with its image (Pictures/, in the manifest) and rectangle shape with its words. `SheetChart`'s drawing code
      shared by chart, picture and text box (`anchored`). `a picture and a text box put on a sheet` (both formats, LibreOffice's
      conversions); emulator: a text box at B7, a picture at C14.
      Drawings moved, sized, taken away done (office-F session, 18 Oct): while editing, a picture, chart, shape or text box tapped is
      chosen (Excel's green frame; its own tab, named for what it is): dragged, it moves to the cell its corner is dropped on; Size
      (width and height in Words' unit); Delete. Found by its place in the file (`SheetDrawing.ordinal`: Excel's anchors, LibreOffice's
      frames and shapes as the reader counts them); `SheetDrawings`. `drawings moved sized and taken away` (both formats, LibreOffice's
      conversions); emulator: a shape dragged from C8 to G13, deleted. shortcut: a move lands on a cell's corner (its offset in the
      cell not kept); Size keeps no aspect lock.
      Shape done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Insert › Shape — Words' and Slides' `ShapesDialog` (styles, fill, outline, every preset),
      the shape at the chosen cell sized as Words sizes it: Excel's preset shape (prstGeom, arrows' line ends), LibreOffice's custom
      shape with Words' geometry (`ShapeGeometry.odfGeometry`) and a graphic style of its own. `shapes put on a sheet` (both formats,
      LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: an orange heart at C8 of an .ods.
- [x] **Formulas**: browse functions by category (the typing row exists); named ranges (Name Manager); show what a
      cell uses and what uses it; error checking; more functions — the dynamic ones (XLOOKUP, FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE),
      checked against LibreOffice as the 129 are.
      Browse by category done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Formulas › Insert function — Excel's categories (Maths, Statistics, Logical,
      Text, Date and time, Lookup, Information) over the cell bar's own list (`SheetFunctions.all`, its arguments and words; seven it
      lacked though Tables works them out added: CEILING.MATH, FLOOR.MATH, STDEV.S, STDEVP, VAR.S, VARP, RANK.EQ), a search; tapped, a
      new formula in the cell or put in where one types (`FunctionsDialog`). `functions in categories`; emulator: =MAX( from Statistics.
      Named ranges done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Formulas › Names while editing — Excel's Name Manager: the workbook's names and
      what each stands for, Delete, and a new name for the chosen cells (Excel's rules for names); Excel's definedNames, LibreOffice's
      table:named-range — whose names are now read too, lazily (they sit at content.xml's end) when a formula first needs one, so
      =SUM(Amounts) works on an .ods. `SheetNames`, `Workbook.nameList`. `names defined and taken away` (both formats, a formula using
      it, LibreOffice's conversions both ways); emulator: Amounts for B2:B3 of an .ods, =SUM(Amounts) 1192.50.
      Seen on the way (not changed): in an .ods a new formula's result shows the phone's separators (1,192.50) beside the file's
      own stored text in LibreOffice's (1.192,50) — older behaviour; worth a look with Words' and Tables' number display.
      Trace and error checking done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Formulas › Precedents (the cells the chosen cell's formula reads, names
      followed), Dependents (this sheet's formulas reading it), Error checking (each tap the next error cell, "#DIV/0! in C7 (1 of 3)"),
      Remove marks — marked on the sheet as found cells are (Excel draws arrows). `SheetTrace`; `formulas traced and errors found`;
      emulator: B5's B2:B3 marked. shortcut: another sheet's cells are not marked.
      Newer functions' names in files fixed (office-F session, 18 Oct): Excel keeps XLOOKUP, IFS, TEXTJOIN, MAXIFS, STDEV.S and the rest
      as "_xlfn.XLOOKUP(" (FILTER, SORT "_xlfn._xlws."), LibreOffice as "COM.MICROSOFT.XLOOKUP(" — a formula typed here was saved
      bare (Excel shows #NAME? then), and a file's prefixed ones read as unknown functions (never worked out again). Now read without,
      written with them (`SheetCalc.fromFile/toXlsx/toOds`, names as LibreOffice 26.2 writes them). `newer functions named as files name
      them` (both formats); full run after it: unit 474, 0 failing, 2 skipped; sweep 349 + 29, none failing.
      Dynamic arrays done (office-F session, 18 Oct): FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE and SEQUENCE (with XLOOKUP, already there) — their results
      spill into the cells below and right (`SheetCalc.Arr`; comparisons and arithmetic on ranges work cell by cell, so FILTER(A:A,
      B:B>5) works; SUM(FILTER(…)) too); a spill follows its data, a value in its way gives #SPILL!, cleared it goes
      (`SheetCell.spill`/`spilledFrom`, `SheetRecalc`). Saved as Excel's array formula over its cells (Excel shows {=…}) and
      LibreOffice's matrix, and those read back as spills. `results spilled`, `a spill saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions
      — it works them out again itself); emulator: =SEQUENCE(4) down F2:F5. Full run after it: unit 476, 0 failing, 2 skipped; sweep
      349 + 29, none failing. shortcut: a formula reading a spill's lower cells is worked out again at the next change, not at once;
      SORT by columns and SORTBY not yet.
- [x] **Data**: a sort that changes the file, by several columns; the filter saved as the file's AutoFilter; remove
      duplicates; text to columns; data validation; group and outline rows; subtotals.
      Remove duplicates done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Data › Remove duplicates on the chosen rows, Excel's question (the first row
      headers?), the rows alike after the first gone (any case, spaces round trimmed: `SheetInput.unique`), the rest moved up — cell
      changes, one step of Undo; not on formulas. `duplicate rows found`; emulator: a CSV's two duplicates removed.
      Text to columns done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Data › Text to columns — a column's words cut at a comma, semicolon, tab, space,
      slash or dash (not inside quotes; spaces: runs as one) into the cells to its right, each typed as if there (numbers stay numbers):
      `SheetInput.split`, one step of Undo. `text cut into columns`; emulator: Crete/Rhodes/Corfu into three cells.
      Sort that changes the file done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › Sort while editing — Excel's dialog: the chosen cells, else
      the current region round the cell (`SheetSortRows.region`); My data has headers (guessed as Excel does); Sort by and up to two
      Then by, each a column (by its heading) and A → Z or Z → A. Excel's order (numbers, words in any case, TRUE/FALSE, errors, blanks
      last either way; rows alike keep their order), formulas moving with their rows; cell changes, one step of Undo; merged cells
      refused. The view's own sort (A → Z on a column's tab) stays as it was. `rows sorted`; emulator: a CSV by Score Z→A, Name A→Z.
      Filter saved as the file's AutoFilter done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › Keep filter in file (the view's filter: Excel's
      autoFilter with its filterColumn values and _FilterDatabase name, sheetPr filterMode, the rows it hides hidden; LibreOffice's
      anonymous database range with its filter conditions and set items, rows visibility "filter") and Remove file filter (every row
      shown again). An .xlsx's AutoFilter values are now read and become the view's filter when the sheet opens (Clear filter shows
      its rows). `SheetAutoFilter`. `an AutoFilter kept in the file` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions both ways); emulator: Βήτα
      filtered out of A, kept, saved. shortcut: an .ods's filter values are not read (its filtered rows show hidden).
      Group and outline rows done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › Group / Ungroup the chosen rows (a level deeper or less), and on a
      grouped row (or the row after a group) Collapse / Expand — Excel's row outlineLevel, hidden, collapsed on the summary row and
      sheetFormatPr outlineLevelRow; LibreOffice's table:table-row-group (display "false", rows visibility "collapse"); both read
      (`Sheet.rowLevels`). `SheetOutline`. `rows grouped and collapsed` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: rows 2–3 of
      an .ods grouped, collapsed, expanded. shortcut: no outline bar beside the row numbers (the ribbon has the buttons); columns not
      grouped; rows across a group's edge not grouped in an .ods.
      Subtotals done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › Subtotal — Excel's dialog (at each change in a column, Sum/Count/Average/Max/
      Min/Product, the columns to total): a row after each group ("North Total", SUBTOTAL(9,…)), a Grand Total, each group's rows
      outlined — one change to the file, rows put in as Insert row does (`SheetShift`, every reference following). SUBTOTAL added to
      the engine, leaving out cells that are subtotals themselves (`Context.formulaOf`), so the Grand Total counts each value once.
      `SheetSubtotal`; `subtotals made` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: Region/Sales → 30, 12, 3, Grand Total 45.
      Drop-down lists done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › Drop-down list on the chosen cells — the values typed, comma-separated
      (Excel's Source box), Take away; Excel's list dataValidation and LibreOffice's table:content-validation (`SheetLists`, a change to
      the file), both read (`Sheet.lists`/`listAt`, `SheetList`: a quoted list, or this sheet's cells). While editing, the chosen
      cell's values show as a row under the ribbon to tap; a value typed that is not one of them is refused (Excel's stop).
      `drop-down lists made and taken away` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: E2:E4 Yes/No/Maybe, "No" tapped into
      E3, "Hello" refused, saved and read by LibreOffice. shortcut: a list from another sheet's cells is kept but not looked up.
- [x] **Page layout**: margins, orientation, paper size, print area, rows repeated on every page, fit to pages, header
      and footer, gridlines printed — today Export PDF and Print use the file's own setup, which can't be changed.
      Done (office-F session, 17 Oct): a Page layout tab (Excel's place, after Insert) — Orientation, Size (A4, Letter), Margins (Excel's
      Normal, Wide, Narrow), Scale (actual size, all columns on one page, sheet on one page), Print gridlines, Set / Clear print area —
      each a change to the file (`SheetPageSetup`: Excel's pageSetup, pageMargins, printOptions, sheetPr's fitToPage, _xlnm.Print_Area;
      LibreOffice's page layout on a master page of the sheet's own, its print ranges), and what Export PDF and Print use. LibreOffice's
      page settings are now read too (an .ods printed with Excel's defaults before): its top and bottom count the header's and footer's
      room, as Excel's margins do. `page layout saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: page.ods made landscape.
      Rows repeated on every page done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Page layout › Print titles with rows chosen, Clear print titles —
      Excel's _xlnm.Print_Titles (read and printed before), LibreOffice's table:table-header-rows round the rows, now read too (an .ods
      printed without them before). In `page layout saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator: an .ods's rows 1–2.
      shortcut: columns printed on every page not kept; rows in a row group not wrapped.
      Header and footer done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Page layout › Header and Footer — Excel's ready-made ones (Page 1, Page 1 of ?,
      sheet name, file name…) and Custom… (Left, Centre, Right, with Page, Pages, Sheet, File, Date and Time to put in); kept as
      Excel's codes (`SheetPrint.header`/`footer`, `SheetHeaderFooter`): Excel's headerFooter read and written, LibreOffice's master
      page regions and fields read and written (an .ods's own "sheet name / Page 1" now read, as LibreOffice prints it), and printed:
      Export PDF and Print draw them 0.3" from the edges. In `page layout saved` (both formats, LibreOffice's conversions); emulator:
      "Draft | sheet name" and "Page 1 of ?" in the exported PDF. shortcut: one header for every page (Excel's first/even ones not kept).
- [x] **Review**: protect a sheet (respect a protected one: no typing in locked cells); spelling.
      Respecting a protected sheet done (office-F session, 17 Oct): Excel's sheetProtection and LibreOffice's table:protected read
      (`Sheet.protected`), each look's Locked (Excel's protection locked, LibreOffice's cell-protect; on by default: `SheetStyle.locked`);
      a change to a locked cell refused where every change passes (`SheetHistory.apply`/`locked`, with a message), typing not begun,
      whole-file changes refused on a protected sheet. `a protected sheet's locked cells kept` (Excel's, and LibreOffice's .ods of it);
      emulator: a protected copy of sheet.xlsx refused typing.
      Protect / Unprotect made here (office-F session, 18 Oct): a sheet's tab › Protect (a password twice, or none) and Unprotect (its
      password asked when it has one, checked against the file's hash: Excel's SHA-512 or its old 16-bit one, LibreOffice's SHA-256 or
      SHA-1), and Home › Lock cell (Excel's Format › Lock Cell) to leave cells open to typing — now saved (Excel's protection locked,
      LibreOffice's cell-protect; Shrink to fit, read since step 6, now saved too). `SheetProtect`; `Sheet.guarded`. `a sheet protected
      and unprotected` (both formats; the hashes checked against Python's; LibreOffice's conversions keep the protection, not the
      password — it can't turn one hash into the other); emulator: protected with a password, A2 refused, a wrong password refused,
      unprotected.
      Spelling done (office-F session, 18 Oct): a Review tab, as Excel's — Spelling (Words' Hunspell dictionaries, Greek and English, on
      the phone: `WriterSpelling`): the sheet's words in reading order, each not known shown with its cell and suggestions in Excel's
      dialog (Change, Ignore, Ignore all); also Previous / Next note, New or Edit note, Protect / Unprotect sheet, and Workbook
      statistics (sheets; this sheet's cells, numbers, formulas, words, notes, drawings, used range). `SheetSpelling`; `spelling in a
      sheet` (Words' English dictionary read in the test); emulator: harvst → harvest, ferri → ferry in a CSV, the counts.
- [x] **View**: gridlines and headings on or off; split the window (later).
      Gridlines done (office-F session, 17 Oct): View › Gridlines while editing, kept in the file (`SheetVisibility.gridXlsx`: the sheet
      view's showGridLines; `gridOds`: the sheet's ShowGrid in the view's Tables list, else the view's own — and the reader now takes
      the view's own when a file has no Tables list). `gridlines off and on` (both formats; LibreOffice 26.2 carries them neither way).
      Emulator: off.
      Headings done (office-F session, 18 Oct): View › Headings while editing — Excel's showRowColHeaders (a sheet's view), LibreOffice's
      HasColumnRowHeaders (the whole file's: its headings are one setting); read too (`Sheet.headings`), and off the grid has no
      letters and numbers, the cells from the edge, as Excel. `SheetVisibility.gridXlsx`/`gridOds` take the setting's name.
      `headings off and on` (both formats; LibreOffice carries them both ways); emulator: an .ods's off and on.
      Freeze panes kept in the file done (office-F session, 18 Oct): View › Freeze panes (the rows above and columns left of the chosen
      cell), Freeze top row, Freeze first column, Unfreeze while editing — Excel's frozen pane in the sheet view, LibreOffice's split
      settings in the sheet's view entry (its Views › Tables made when a file has none, as LibreOffice run without a window writes
      them). Viewing alone keeps the view-only "Keep rows above at the top". `panes frozen` (both formats; LibreOffice's .xlsx of the
      .ods keeps it — its .ods made without a window keeps no view at all); emulator: C3 frozen in an .ods.
- [x] **References**, where it makes sense: a **contents sheet** listing every sheet as a link (`#'Sheet'!A1`), for
      workbooks with many sheets; a **Sources sheet** of where the data came from, in the chosen style, with Words'
      dialogs. In-text citations in cells: not planned unless asked.
      Contents sheet done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Insert › Contents sheet (a workbook of two sheets or more) — a first sheet,
      "Contents", each shown sheet's name a link to its A1 (made again, not twice, when there is one); one change to the file:
      Words'-shared parts in a row (`SheetBook` add, delete and move, the cells, `SheetLinks`). `SheetContents`; `a contents sheet made`
      (both formats, twice, LibreOffice shows it); emulator: Contents first with Numbers and Second as links.
      Sources sheet done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Insert › Source — Words' `SourceDialog`; the reference as APA 7 writes it (Words'
      `CiteStyle.APA.entry`, its italics the cell's rich text) on a "Sources" sheet (made the first time, last, its column wide, its
      cells wrapping) under "References", in APA's order. `SheetSources`; `a sources sheet made` (both formats, two sources sorted, the
      italic title kept by LibreOffice both ways); emulator: Kirk, A. (2021). *Olive harvests*. Crete Press. shortcut: a source is kept
      as its reference's words (change its cell to change it), not Words' fields.

**From Excel's ribbon** (checked online 17 Oct: desktop Excel's tabs and groups, and the tablet app's shorter ribbon);
what is not already above:
- [x] **Home**: vertical alignment (top, middle, bottom); text angle (rotated, vertical); indent in a cell; Clear ▸
      contents, formats, all; Fill ▸ series (1, 2, 3…, dates, months) besides down and right; AutoSum on Home as
      Excel has it; **cell styles** (Good, Bad, Heading, Total…); sheet ▸ rename, tab colour, move or copy.
      Fill ▸ Series done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Home › Series with cells chosen — Excel's dialog: Linear, Growth, and for a date
      Day, Weekday, Month, Year, a step value; down each column (or along the row) from its first cell's number or date to the chosen
      cells' end (`SheetFill.stepped`; cell changes, one step of Undo). The fill handle now also runs Excel's own lists: month and day
      names, long and short, in their capitals and step (Jan, Mar → May). `month and day names and Fill series`; emulator: 15/03/2023
      by month down C2:C8.
      Cell styles done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Home › Cell styles — Excel's gallery (Normal, Good, Bad, Neutral, Calculation, Check
      cell, Explanatory, Input, Linked cell, Note, Output, Warning, Title, Heading 1–4, Total; Office theme colours), each drawn in its
      look; tapped, the parts Excel's style includes (font, fill, border) put on the chosen cells, the rest of their look kept
      (`SheetLook.STYLES`/`styled`; cell looks, one step of Undo). Saved as looks, not as named styles (Excel shows them as Normal).
      Fixed on the way: a double border in .ods written as LibreOffice writes Excel's (1.76pt double-thin — a bare "double" it took
      as thin) and read back as double. `cell styles xlsx/ods` (LibreOffice's conversions: its .xlsx of an .ods with a themed
      Default style drops every font colour — a LibreOffice quirk, it shows ours); emulator: Heading 1 on A1:D1.
      Vertical alignment, indent, text angle done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Home › Top / Middle / Bottom, Decrease / Increase indent,
      Orientation ▾ (Excel's: horizontal, angle counterclockwise / clockwise, rotate up / down) — cell looks; .ods now writes the angle
      (style:rotation-angle) and indent (paragraph margin, 0.2965 cm a level as LibreOffice turns Excel's) and reads the indent; a cell's
      angle is Excel's number everywhere now (an .ods angled down was read negative). `alignment xlsx/ods` (LibreOffice's conversions);
      emulator: Alpha angled, Βήτα indented twice.
      Clear ▸ done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Selection › Clear ▾ — Excel's Clear all, formats, contents, notes, hyperlinks (contents
      and formats as cell changes, one step of Undo; notes and links one change to the file, Words'-dialog parts `SheetNotes`/`SheetLinks`
      cell by cell). Emulator: A2's note cleared, B3 cleared of all (the total recalculated). No new logic beyond those tested parts.
      Sheet ▸ copy and tab colour, AutoSum on Home done (office-F session, 18 Oct): a sheet's tab › Copy (Excel's Move or Copy › Create a
      copy: "Name (2)" after it — .ods the whole table, .xlsx its cells, looks and links; shortcut: an .xlsx copy leaves its pictures,
      charts, notes and tables behind) and Tab colour (Excel's tabColor, LibreOffice's tableooo:tab-color; `SheetVisibility.colourXlsx/
      colourOds` share Hide's table-style code); Home › AutoSum. `a sheet copied and a tab coloured` (both formats; LibreOffice shows the
      copy); emulator: Numbers (2) made and its tab pink.
      Insert and delete cells shifting the rest done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Selection › Insert ▾ (Shift cells down / right) and
      Delete ▾ (up / left), and in the right-click menu — cell changes, one step of Undo (`SheetCellShift`): the cells after the chosen
      ones in their columns (rows) move, every formula on the sheet reading them follows (`SheetShift` given `within`: only those columns
      or rows; whole rows/columns and ranges partly in them stay); merged cells in the way refused, as Excel. `cells shifted`; emulator:
      D2 shifted down (B2's merge below refused). shortcut: merges, rules, validations, links, notes and other sheets' formulas stay.
- [x] **Insert**: Equation and WordArt (Words'); header and footer (with Page layout); icons (later); slicers
      (later, with PivotTables).
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct): header and footer (Page layout, above); Insert › Equation (Words' EquationDialog and
      MathDrawable, as Slides': the equation put on at the chosen cell as a picture, its letters 16 pt). Emulator: x²+a/b at F14.
      shortcut: a picture, not Excel's own equation (OMML in a text box), so it is not edited again as an equation.
      Insert › WordArt (Words' WordArt strip: a look and a bend; OK asks its words, "Your text here"): Excel's WordArt text box
      (no fill or line; the letters' outline, glow and shadow in the run; prstTxWarp), LibreOffice's styled words or, bent, its
      fontwork (`SheetChart.wordArtXlsx` / `wordArtOds`). Read back with its size, weight, effects and bend, and drawn on the
      sheet with Words' EffectSpan and TextBoxDrawable.bent (`WordArt put on a sheet`, both ways through LibreOffice; its
      outline is hollow letters there, as in Words' .odt). Emulator: an orange arch and a blue outlined one at F8.
      Not done: icons (later), slicers (later, with PivotTables).
- [x] **Formulas**: Recently used; Insert function by category (as Excel's dialog: a search, the arguments explained);
      Calculate now and automatic / manual; trace precedents and dependents as arrows; evaluate a formula step by step.
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Insert function by category with a search (FunctionsDialog); Precedents, Dependents and
      Error checking (cells marked, `SheetTrace`); Recently used (the last ten functions put in — Insert function, the row of
      functions while typing, AutoSum's — kept in Words' store; a ribbon menu, and first in Insert function). Emulator: AVERAGE
      there after Average.
      Formulas › Calculate sheet (Excel's: every formula here worked out again, NOW and TODAY moving on; one step of Undo).
      Emulator: =NOW()*86400 moved on by 20. Not done, on purpose: manual calculation — Tetra works out on every change (a file
      set to manual keeps its setting); other sheets are worked out as their own cells change.
      Formulas › Evaluate formula (Excel's dialog: Evaluate shows the next step, the leftmost innermost part replaced by its value —
      `SheetCalc.steps` on the tree, written back with `SheetCalc.show`; `formula evaluated step by step`). Emulator: B5's
      =SUM(B2:B3) to =1192.5. Precedents and dependents are marked cells, not arrows.
- [x] **Data**: import a CSV or text file into the sheet; Reapply and Clear the filter; advanced filter (later);
      Flash fill (later); Goal seek; consolidate (later); forecast (later).
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Data › From text/CSV (the system's file picker; the table typed in from the chosen cell, numbers
      and dates read as typing reads them, one step of Undo) and Goal seek (Excel's dialog; `SheetGoalSeek`: the sheet's own
      working-out tried by the secant method, then put back; the found value one change). `goal sought`; emulator: B3 made 765.5 so
      B5 is 2000; sort.csv imported at F8. Clear filter was there (a column's tab, its chip); Data › Reapply (while a filter or sort is
      on) works them out again on the cells as they are now, as Excel's.
- [x] **Review**: next / previous comment, show all; notes (Excel's older comments) apart from threaded comments;
      workbook statistics (as Words' counts); protect the workbook's structure; accessibility check (later).
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct): Previous / Next note, Workbook statistics, Protect sheet (above); Show all notes (each
      note in Excel's yellow box beside its cell, drawn over the cells, frozen rows' and columns' too). Emulator: A2's note shown.
      Review › Protect workbook (its structure: no sheet added, deleted, renamed, moved or hidden — refused with a word, as Excel;
      a password or none): Excel's workbookProtection lockStructure (SHA-512 as Protect sheet), LibreOffice's structure-protected
      (`SheetProtect.bookXlsx` / `bookOds`; `a workbook's structure protected and unprotected`). LibreOffice keeps it in an .ods,
      but its .xlsx filter neither reads nor writes Excel's lock (26.2). Emulator: + refused while protected, then unprotected.
      Threaded comments (Excel 365's) are read with their replies ("Ann: …" a line each); a note put on, changed or cleared on
      such a cell now takes the thread away too, so Excel shows the note, not the old thread over it (`a threaded comment read
      and a note put in its place`). Not written: replies (none of the user's 29 workbooks has a thread, and no Excel here to
      check one) — later, when asked. Accessibility check: later, as planned.
- [x] **View**: page break preview and page layout view (with Page layout); freeze the first column, and rows and
      columns together; zoom to the chosen cells; show or hide the formula bar, headings, gridlines, sheet tabs.
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct) but the page views: freezing (above, kept in the file); View › Zoom to selection (the chosen
      cells fill the screen: `SheetPainter.fit`), Formula bar and Sheet tabs shown or hidden (the viewer's, as Excel's View
      options; the bar comes back while typing); headings and gridlines kept in the file (above). Emulator: A1:D5 zoomed to, the
      bar and tabs hidden. Not yet: page break preview, page layout view.
      View › Page break preview (Excel's: the pages as `sheetPages` cuts them for printing and PDF — each framed in blue with
      "Page n" across it, what is not printed greyed; a print setting changed shows at once). Emulator: a 120-row sheet, pages 1–2.
      View › Page layout (Excel's: the sheet as its pages print — Export PDF's pages with margins, header and footer, white on
      grey one under another; a page tapped goes back to the cells at its first). Emulator: page 2 tapped, A54 chosen.
- [x] **Draw**: pen and highlighter over the sheet (Words' Draw tab), saved as ink.
      Done 18 Oct (office-F): a Draw tab, Draw on sheet — Words' DrawDialog (two pens, the highlighter, eraser, Undo) on the cells
      as the sheet shows them from its top left (960 × 640 at 100 %), the drawing put on where it was drawn as Words' and Slides'
      ink: a see-through PNG with its strokes kept in it (pictures now take an offset in their cell: `a drawing put on inside
      a cell`, both ways through LibreOffice). Emulator: a red stroke from B16 to F19. Not done: drawing on it again (Words'
      redraw from the kept strokes) — later, when asked.
- [x] **From Words**: AutoSave, Save a copy, Save as, Rename; Find and Replace (above); Format painter (above); the
      keyboard bar while typing in a cell.
      Keyboard bar done 18 Oct (office-F): Words' KeyboardBar and rememberDictation while a cell is typed in, on tablet and
      phone (Tables hides its ribbon while typing on both); Bold, Italic, Underline and the highlighter (the fill) on the chosen
      cells, voice typing in at the cursor, ⋯ puts the typing in and brings the ribbon back. Emulator: "hello" bold on yellow.
      Done (office-F session, 18 Oct): File › Save a copy ("<name> (copy)" beside it), AutoSave (Words' own
      setting, shared: a few seconds after a change, never while a cell is being typed in), Save as (the new file open from then
      on), Rename (its versions and draft with it). Emulator: each on a copy of sheet.xlsx. Note for the user: AutoSave is Words'
      setting, so with it on (as on this emulator) Tables now saves by itself too — the File tab's AutoSave turns it off for both.
      Fixed 18 Oct (office-F): a save took Undo away (the file was read again), so with AutoSave on Undo went four seconds after
      each change. Now a save keeps what is open and Undo, as Word's: the edits are written onto a copy of the file as opened
      (kept in the working folder), and whole-file steps never start from the file itself. Emulator: a cell typed and a row
      inserted, each autosaved, both undone, saved again — the file as it was.

### D. Words
Its own open items stay in THE PLAN's Phase 2 (HANDOFF.md). Anything the UI/UX pass finds in Words goes into A.


## Calendar — the last app (designed 17 Oct, built 18 Oct on the `calendar` branches; the real pair still to do)

**The user, 17 Oct:** "Everything to be handled as a file on phone, tablet and PC so any AI with the skill is able to
manipulate the events." Claude should organise, create and manage the calendar by editing files on the computer, and
the phone and tablet follow through sync. Many calendars, each with its colour; create, edit, delete; all-day and
timed; repeats; several reminders each, repeating ones ("notify for 3 days at 9:00 before"); import .ics and Google
Takeout, export .ics. Big screen like Google Calendar on the web (dark), phone like Outlook mobile. Pink icon
(~/Λήψεις/Calendar.png).

### The files (the heart of it)
```
Tetra/Calendar/                      (~/Tetra/Files/Calendar on the PC, /sdcard/Tetra/Calendar on a phone)
  Personal/                          one folder = one calendar; the folder's name is the calendar's name
    color                            one line: #F06292 (the calendar's colour; vdir's own convention)
    dentist-3f9a2c.ics               one event = one iCalendar file
    mum-birthday-81be07.ics
  Work/
    color
    staff-meeting-c2d410.ics         a repeating event is one file (its RRULE; a changed or cancelled day inside it)
```
- **Why this layout**: it is "vdir", the layout khal, vdirsyncer and todoman already use — a standard, not ours. One
  event per file means an AI (or a person) adds, changes or deletes one event by touching one file, and sync carries
  only that file. A whole-calendar .ics would make every edit a change to one big file, and two devices editing two
  different events would be a sync conflict.
- **Why visible, not a hidden `.calendar` like Notes**: Files sync already carries everything under Tetra that does not
  start with "." (DriveManifest.walk), per file, edits replacing the other side's copy (SYNC_PLAN §6ak). So the Calendar
  needs **no new sync code** on either side, and Claude finds it where the user sees it. Notes needed their own
  endpoint because one note file changes often from both sides; events rarely do.
- **Inside an event file**: standard iCalendar (RFC 5545) — `VCALENDAR` › `VEVENT` with `UID`, `DTSTAMP`, `SUMMARY`,
  `DTSTART`/`DTEND` (all-day as `VALUE=DATE`, the end the day after), `LOCATION`, `DESCRIPTION`, `RRULE` + `EXDATE`
  for repeats, `VEVENT`s with `RECURRENCE-ID` in the same file for one changed day, `VALARM`s for reminders,
  `LAST-MODIFIED`, `SEQUENCE`. Times carry an IANA zone (`DTSTART;TZID=Europe/Athens:20261020T093000`); Tetra does
  not write VTIMEZONE blocks inside the folder (an AI need not either) but keeps any a file has, and adds them when
  exporting for other apps. Reading is forgiving (LF or CRLF, long or folded lines, UTC `Z` and floating times);
  writing is strict (CRLF, folded at 75). **Anything Tetra does not understand in a file is kept as it was** (attendees,
  X- properties, Google's ids): an edit changes only the lines it changes.
- **File names**: Tetra names a new event after its title plus six letters of its UID (`dentist-3f9a2c.ics`) and never
  renames it (a rename would be a move in sync for nothing). The name means nothing to the reader: the UID inside is
  the identity, and a file an AI writes may be called anything ending in `.ics`.
- **Deleting** = moving the file into `Tetra/Trash/` (sync never deletes; a move into Trash crosses as a move, §6h).
  An AI deletes with `mv`, not `rm` — an `rm`'d file came back from the other device until 23 Oct (SYNC_PLAN 6an:
  now the other devices put theirs in their Trash, but nothing is left here to restore).
- **Moving an event to another calendar** = moving its file to the other folder. **A calendar** = a folder: make one
  with `mkdir` + a `color` file; rename = rename the folder; delete = the folder to Trash.
- **Conflicts**: an event changed on two devices between syncs arrives as `x (2).ics` beside `x.ics`, both with the
  same UID. The Calendar shows one (the newer `LAST-MODIFIED`/`DTSTAMP`) and marks it "2 versions"; the event's card
  offers "Keep this one" (the other goes to Trash). Nothing is thrown away by itself.
- **Which calendars are shown** (the checkboxes) is per device, not in the files — like Google, a choice about this
  screen. `Calendar` becomes a required folder (emblem; cannot be renamed, moved or trashed — DriveRules), on the
  desktop too.

### Repeats and reminders
- **Repeats** in the editor: Does not repeat · Daily · Weekly on Tuesday · Monthly on the 3rd Tuesday / on day 20 ·
  Yearly on 20 October · Every weekday · Custom… (every N days/weeks/months/years, which weekdays, ends never / on a
  date / after N times) — all plain RRULEs. Changing a repeating event asks: **This event · This and following · All
  events** (one day = a `RECURRENCE-ID` override; this-and-following = an `UNTIL` on the old one and a new file from
  that day; delete one day = an `EXDATE`).
- **Reminders**, several per event, each a `VALARM`: At the time · 5, 10, 15, 30 min · 1 h · 1 day before · Custom
  (N min/h/days/weeks). For all-day events: "On the day at 9:00", "N days before at 9:00". **Repeating reminder**
  ("for 3 days at 9:00 before") = one VALARM with `TRIGGER` at the first one (3 days before, 9:00), `REPEAT:2` and
  `DURATION:P1D` — RFC 5545's own repeat, so other apps read it too (Google drops the repeats on import, keeps the first).
  Moving a timed event in Tetra keeps such a reminder at 9:00.
  All day starts at midnight, so "on the day at 9:00" is `TRIGGER:PT9H` (Google: `P0DT9H0M0S`), after the start: it is
  labelled by its day, never "9 hours after", and its hours are the clock's, so it is 09:00 on the days the clocks
  change too (both engines, 24 Oct).
- **New event defaults**: 30 min before (timed), the day before at 9:00 (all-day); a setting.

- **Phone/tablet**: one exact alarm for the **next** reminder only (`AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`,
  `USE_EXACT_ALARM` — allowed for a calendar app — and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` on older Android). When it fires: post
  that reminder (channel "Reminders", high; title, time, place, the calendar's colour; **Snooze 10 min** · tap opens
  the event), then plan the next. The plan is always made **from the files** (an index cached by path + size + time, so
  a thousand events cost a glance), never from a list that could be stale. It is re-planned when the app opens, after
  any edit in Calendar, **after every sync that brought a Calendar file** (also the background SyncJob, app closed),
  on boot, on a time or time-zone change and after an update. A reminder missed while the phone was off is shown on
  boot (up to a day late, marked "missed").
- **Xiaomi**: alarms survive, but a reboot reaches the app only with **Autostart** allowed, and battery saver should be
  "No restrictions" for Tetra; the Calendar asks once, with a button to each setting, and shows a line if notifications
  or exact alarms are off.
- **PC**: the desktop's own `notify()` (Electron notification + the Notifications page), from a timer in the main
  process — it runs while Tetra sits in the tray. The desktop does not start at login yet (SYNC_PLAN §H); Calendar is
  the reason to add that (an autostart .desktop file, a setting).
- Every device reminds (as Google does); Settings › Calendar › "Reminders on this device" switches one off.
- **How fast an AI's edit reaches the phone**: as fast as sync — the background sync runs every 30 min by default (a
  setting), or at once when Tetra is opened. An event Claude adds for "in 10 minutes" will ring on the PC, and on the
  phone only if a sync happens first.

### Import and export
- **Import .ics** (Calendar › Import, or opening an .ics from Files / another app): into a chosen calendar or a new one
  named from the file (`X-WR-CALNAME`, else the file name). Split into one file per UID (overrides stay with their
  event, the VTIMEZONEs they use come along). Importing the same file again **updates** events by UID, no duplicates.
- **Google Takeout**: the Takeout zip (or its `Calendar` folder): each `<name>.ics` becomes a calendar of that name,
  colours from the palette (Takeout carries none). Shows the count per calendar before writing.
- **Export**: a calendar → one .ics (with VTIMEZONEs, `X-WR-CALNAME`, its colour as `X-APPLE-CALENDAR-COLOR`) to share
  or save; all → a zip of one .ics per calendar. Opens in Google Calendar, Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple.
- Not planned: subscribing to an online calendar by URL, Google/CalDAV live sync (no cloud — ask if wanted).

### Screens
- **Big screen** (tablet ≥ 700 dp wide, the PC) — Google Calendar web: top bar ☰ · Today · ‹ › · "October 2026" ·
  Day / Week / Month / Agenda; **left panel** (☰ hides it): **Create**, a small month (days with events dotted, tap to
  go), **My calendars** — each with its coloured checkbox, ⋯ for colour / rename / export / delete, + New calendar,
  Import; **main area**: the month grid (default; events as coloured chips, all-day as bars, "+3 more"), the week and
  day grids (hours down the side, events as blocks, the now-line in red, all-day row on top; drag to move or resize on
  the tablet with a finger, on the PC with the mouse; tap an empty slot to create there). An event tapped opens its card
  (popover on the PC, side sheet on the tablet); Edit opens the editor as a dialog.
- **Phone** — Outlook mobile: the top is the **week row** of the chosen day (days with events dotted), swipe for the
  next week, **pull it down to the whole month** and back up; below it the **agenda**: days one after another from the
  chosen one, each event as time · length · coloured dot · title · place, all-day ones first; scrolling the agenda moves
  the week row along. + (bottom right) creates; ☰ opens the calendars (the same checkbox list) as a drawer. Views
  menu: Agenda (default) · Day · 3 days · Month. The editor is full-screen. A tablet in portrait is a phone layout
  only if under 700 dp.
- **Editor** (both): title; calendar (coloured chip); All day; start and end date/time (a zone line only if not the
  device's); Repeat; Reminders (list + Add); Place; Notes. Delete in the event's card and the editor's ⋯.
- Dark and light follow Tetra's theme; English only (strings in code like the rest, localisation later).
- **Home**: a pink Calendar group — the big card (the user's icon) with **Today's next event** and **New event**
  beside it; the launcher icon as the other applets (Settings › App icons). Colour `applet_calendar` = the icon's pink.

### The skill (`tetra-calendar`)
In `skills/tetra-calendar/` (repo) and `~/.claude/skills/tetra-calendar/`: SKILL.md — where the folder is, the layout,
ready-to-copy templates (timed, all-day, repeating, with reminders, a moved or cancelled day), how to move, delete
(to Trash), make/rename a calendar, the rules (UID unique, DTSTAMP, bump `LAST-MODIFIED`/`SEQUENCE` on edit, IANA
zones, never `rm`), and that the phone sees it after the next sync. Plus `calendar.py` (standard library only):
`agenda FROM TO` lists events with repeats expanded (so Claude can answer "what's on next week" and find free time
without doing RRULE in its head), and `check` validates every file (missing UID or DTSTAMP, end before start, duplicate
UIDs, unknown zone, bad RRULE) — run after every edit.

### Code (smallest that holds)
- **Android**: `Calendar.kt` (the vdir: list calendars, read/write/move events, the content-line reader/writer that keeps
  unknown lines, the occurrence expander), `CalendarScreen.kt` (both layouts, editor), `CalendarAlarms.kt` (planner,
  receiver, boot). Repeats expanded with **lib-recur** (dmfs, the RRULE library of Android's OpenTasks, 0.17.1, small, pure Java) rather
  than our own — RFC 5545's RRULE (BYSETPOS, negative BYMONTHDAY, WKST…) is where hand-written code goes wrong.
  Hook: `SyncClient.receiveFile`/sync result → re-plan alarms when a path under `Calendar/` changed.
- **Desktop**: `calendar.js` (main: the vdir, `fs.watch` on Calendar so an AI's edit shows at once, the reminder timer),
  `src/Calendar.tsx` (the Google-web layout), `CALENDAR_CALLS` IPC like Notes; **ical.js** (Mozilla's, Thunderbird's)
  for parsing and repeats; `calendar.js` added to `build.files`.
- **Shared test fixtures** (`test/resources/calendar/`): Google's, Outlook's, Thunderbird's and hand-written (AI-style)
  files, and RRULE cases with their expected dates — run on both sides so the two engines agree.

### Steps (each a commit, each checked on the tablet, then the phone and PC)
- [x] (a308980) 1. Android: the files — `Calendar.kt` read/write/expand (lib-recur) + fixtures (Google's, Claude-style,
      repeats), `CalendarTest`; `Calendar` a required folder with its emblem.
- [x] (242c094) 2. Android: the screens — big screen month/week/day/agenda + side panel; phone week row (pulled down: the
      month) + agenda, Day, 3 days, Month; Home's pink group (the user's icon, the next event), launcher icon.
- [x] (4cc9368) 3. Android: create (Create, +, an empty hour, Home's New event), edit, delete; calendars (new, colour,
      rename, delete, show/hide); repeats (presets + Custom) with This / Following / All; Keep this one for a conflict.
      **Not done: drag an event to move or resize it on the tablet** (tap and edit works).
- [x] (4c43b7a) 4. Android: reminders — one exact alarm (USE_EXACT_ALARM) for the next, re-planned from the files on open,
      edit, a file landing, after every sync (SyncClient), boot, clock/zone change, update; missed ones up to a day;
      Snooze 10 min; notifications asked once; Xiaomi note (Autostart, battery). Emulator: rang at the second, Snooze
      re-rang, the alarm came back after a reboot.
- [x] (4c43b7a) 5. Android: import .ics / Takeout zip (side panel, or "Open with › Tetra Calendar"), export one .ics
      (VTIMEZONEs written) or all as a zip.
- [x] (7584567) 6. `skills/tetra-calendar` (SKILL.md + calendar.py: list, agenda, find, add, new-calendar, trash, check),
      installed in ~/.claude/skills; its agenda gives the app's days on the fixtures.
- [x] (Drive c2ab218, ea3e221) 7. Desktop: `calendar.js` (own engine, the phone's fixtures and answers in
      test/calendar.test.js), `Calendar.tsx` (Google web layout, editor, card, import/export), fs.watch, reminders via
      notify(), "Reminders on this computer", "Start Tetra when I log in" (autostart, --hidden); Calendar a required
      folder in Files. Not done: a VTIMEZONE written for a zone the files only name (the phone writes them).
- [ ] 8. The real pair (waits for the user and the tablet): merge `calendar` into writer-library/main (Android) and
      bidirectional-sync (Drive), install on the tablet and the PC; an event made on each device and by Claude, edited on
      two at once (conflict), deleted, all three agree; a reminder rings on the tablet with the app closed and after a
      reboot. Then the user's own calendar: Google Takeout imported.
- Later, if wanted: drag to move/resize; multi-day events as one bar (Google's) instead of a chip per day.

### Tetra's island instead of Google's panel (the user, 18 Oct, relayed by the main session)
"After the calendar app is finished try to bring it closer to the UX with an island and bottom drawer that opens for
the rest like what calendars to see and what not. The same for the big screen not hamburger menu an island that is
close to the UX we are using to the rest of the Tetra app." And: "The calendar will go to desktop as well. So it can
sync and you to be able to work with it with a skill just by editing files like normal."
- [x] (0ed5b56) Phone and tablet: no hamburger, no side panel. Tetra's bottom island (Files' and
      Notes' `IslandBottomBar` / `IslandNavigationItem`): the views (phone: Agenda, Day, Month; tablet: Day, Week, Month,
      Agenda) and New; pulled up, the drawer (the same `ModalBottomSheet` as Notes' and Files'): the calendars with their
      coloured boxes (show/hide, ⋯ colour/name/export/delete), New calendar, Import, Export all, the small month on a
      big screen, 3 days on a phone, Reminders on this device. The top keeps Today, ‹ › and the month's name.
- [x] (Drive 7b9115c, 218f4ea) Desktop the same: Notes' bottom island (Day, Week, Month, Agenda, New event, Calendars)
      and its drawer for the rest, not the side panel; Drive's HANDOFF.md says where it is. The desktop part is already files only (no database copy): it reads Files/Calendar on every
      look and fs.watch shows any edit (Claude's, the skill's, sync's) at once; the skill's paths (~/Tetra/Files/Calendar)
      are what both apps read and write. Checked 18 Oct: a file made by the skill's calendar.py is read by the desktop with
      the same days and reminder times (and by the phone: the same fixtures and answers in both test suites).
- [x] (534e341, bc0f3ff; Drive 7736b99, 0559fd0) Closer to the rest of Tetra (the user via the main session, 18 Oct, after
      0ed5b56 on the emulator): Files' top (Back and the month in islands, Today ‹ › beside them; the desktop's
      title-island); Files' bottom (the island at the left with the current view labelled, 3 days on the phone's island,
      New event the round island at the right); the drawer pads for the navigation bar; overlapping events readable as
      Google lays them out (starts within 15 min side by side, later ones cascade on top indented, under 30 min a chip).
- [x] The user's own Google calendar (~/Λήψεις/…ical.zip, kept out of both repos and out of ~/Tetra): 393 events in on the
      emulator through Open with › Tetra Calendar, the desktop engine and the phone engine (CalendarRealImportTest, run
      only with TETRA_CALENDAR_ZIP); out again, all 397 entries line for line equal; imported twice, no doubles; the phone,
      the desktop and the skill agree on all 1639 occurrences and 758 reminder times (2015–2030). It found a bug, fixed:
      two events of one title whose Google UIDs begin alike got one file name, one lost; names now use the UID's hash and
      never take another's. The skill's helper is now tetra_calendar.py (calendar.py hid Python's own module).

### Wide and narrow, and kinds of event (the user, 18 Oct, relayed by the main session; overrides part of the island ask)
"On a wide screen dont hide the calendar or the opitions as it was then the island it would hide only the setting day
week month year. On narow screen keep the calendar at the top I like to see you now a week or two or three or month and
be able to choose." Then: "Alltho to be closer to our thing we could bring calendar to the bottom and ajenta to the top".
And for Home: "On the default buttons at home add New : Shedule : burthday : reminder."
- [x] (0cdba78, 1eb85cf; Drive 050cff8) **Wide** (tablet landscape, desktop): the small month and the calendars (show/hide,
      New calendar, Import, Export) always beside the grid; the island only Day · Week · Month · Year (a new Year view)
      and New event; the drawer only what is left (the reminders switch). The top in Tetra's pill style.
- [x] **Narrow** (phone, tablet portrait, a narrow desktop window): the events on top; a small calendar at the bottom,
      just above the island — 1, 2 or 3 weeks or the month, its handle dragged up for more and down for fewer (kept);
      a day tapped there moves the events to it. The island and drawer as before. Same at the same widths on the PC.
- [x] **Kinds**: Home's Calendar card gets four tiles as Office's — New, Schedule, Birthday, Reminder — and + in the app
      offers the same. Birthday: a Birthdays calendar (made if missing), all day, yearly, name and date, the year
      optional (kept as X-TETRA-BIRTH-YEAR so the age shows). Schedule: chosen weekdays, a time, a start and end — one
      event `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=…;UNTIL=…`; templates "Elementary school year" (1 Sep – 26 Jun, the user's dates)
      and "High school year" (1 Sep – 15 Jun: **the end date needs the user's confirmation**), both editable; "Skip the
      Holidays calendar's days" adds an EXDATE for each. Reminder: one event with a list of notifications. All plain
      .ics the tetra-calendar skill reads and writes.
- [x] (1eb85cf, 37a2c86, f7ccd75) The user on the tablet, 18 Oct: the top floats over the content as in Files; reminders
      in the Hyper Island with a ✕ Done (pink in a black circle with a pink rim) and Snooze — ongoing, as Xiaomi's Clock
      timer; seen on the tablet (HyperOS raises no island for the app in front, so Settings › Calendar's test reminder
      comes 5 s later); ✕ marks that time done and its other reminders do not ring. Settings › Calendar: notifications,
      alarms on time, battery, Hyper Island, Autostart, the reminders switch, a test reminder, Import, Export all.
      Desktop the same at the same widths (Drive branch `calendar`, 18 Oct).
- [x] (1f00114; Drive 756d805) **Share with Claude** (the user, 18 Oct: "Add a share with Claude in the settings of the
      calendar app for the user to download the skill"): skills/tetra-calendar the one source, zipped into the Android app
      at build time (assets/tetra-calendar.zip) and copied into desktop/skills before a desktop build. Android, in the
      drawer and Settings › Calendar: Share (the share sheet) and Save to Files. Desktop, in the Settings drawer: Save as…
      (~/Downloads) and Copy to ~/.claude/skills. "Lets Claude read and change this calendar by editing its files."
- [x] (322fe65; Drive bc47403) Wide screens (the user, 18 Oct: "The today and the arrows for the tablet place them at the
      bottom between the + and the island on its own island", then "Closer to the + button to be easily reachable with
      the thum"): the top keeps the title; the views' island at the left, ‹ Today › in its own island beside the + at the
      right; the grid stops above them. Phone and narrow windows unchanged (no room at the bottom beside the week strip).
- [x] (7ed20a5; Drive 2cf2fa2; SYNC_PLAN 6am) Calendar changes travel at once (the user, 18 Oct: "once there is an update
      on calendar like on notes send it imediatly across devices as soon as connection available"): a Calendar-only sync
      on Files' own path (`/files/manifest/scoped`, scope `calendar`), 2.5 s after a change, waiting for a network as a
      job; the computer's changes (the skill too) by its nudge, or a quarter-hourly look with Tetra closed. Reusable for
      the Timer (its own scope). **Not yet run between real devices** (the emulator cannot scan the pairing code).
- [x] (46a6309; Drive 83c4e50) **Refresh, Trash and Settings at the top; no delay after a change** (the user, 18 Oct):
      Refresh beside the title (tablet/desktop), the Trash beside it (phone: in the drawer) with each event's days left
      and Restore; desktop Settings is Gallery's tune menu with Share with Claude. Saves push at once (desktop: 300 ms).
      **Run on the real pair** (tablet ↔ installed PC Tetra, older, so the whole sync): Thursday/Friday lessons arrived
      7 s after Refresh; the user's new event reached the PC in seconds, its deletion was in the PC's Trash 3 s later and
      stayed gone. The phone's hotspot first blocked device-to-device traffic (restarting it fixed that). New .deb:
      Drive-worktrees/calendar/desktop/release/local-drive-desktop_0.3.0-beta.4_amd64.deb (not installed).

- [x] (Drive ca93bdb; 2f3c21e) **Clock and month pickers on the desktop; a repeat's cancelled days follow its time**
      (the user, 18 Oct: ΤΠΕ Β' at 11:50–12:25 snapped to 11:45–12:20, "why a list and not a clock", "why is the date not
      a calendar"): every time field types any minute ("12:25", "1225", "925") and opens a clock as the phone's (hours
      00–11 outside, 12–23 inside, then minutes); every date field opens a month (‹ ›, the year list for birthdays,
      Today). Moving a repeat's start moves its EXDATEs and RECURRENCE-IDs by as much, desktop and Android (a test in
      each). Checked in the desktop source build against the real library, nothing saved; installed Tetra restarted.
      Not done: the user's own ΤΠΕ Β' file (its EXDATEs are still at 11:50) — the main session asks the user; "this and
      following" still drops the cancelled days after the split (both apps).

- [x] (73b2354; Drive 7111221) **"This and following" keeps the cancelled and changed days after the split**:
      the new event gets the old series' EXDATEs and RECURRENCE-ID days from the split day on, moved by as much as that
      day moved (shiftRepeat), desktop and Android (a test in each, the staff-meeting fixture). Both suites pass; not
      tried in the apps by hand.

- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) **A place opens in the maps app** (the user: "when I add a location link … from Google
      maps here maps or what ever … make it a button"): the event card shows the place without its link and an "Open in
      Maps" button — a link with coordinates (Google's @lat,lng / q=, HERE's map=, OSM's #map=) or a plain address goes as
      geo: to the default maps app, a short link (maps.app.goo.gl) opens as itself; web links in the notes are tappable.
      `CalendarPlace` + CalendarPlaceTest; seen on the emulator (opened Google Maps at the link's point). Android only —
      the desktop's card not yet; not on the phone/tablet yet (neither connected).


## Timer (18 Oct, timer session; branches `timer` in both repos, worktrees Drive-Android-worktrees/timer-b50bfc and Drive-worktrees/timer)

**The user, 18 Oct:** "start it a simple timer with the clock widget like the calendar to select time and some recently used
times below and the ability to pin some of them. Active notification on the hyper island with pause and stop buttons. Sync
check every 30 sec. I mean as long as they start and stop together no real sync is needed. Just stopping the one device or
clicking ok stops all of them." Then, while it was built: "If I click stop or pause you sync that moment, so it controls all
the devices"; "we cant write every second to memory"; "at the timers card to the right side add 6m 15m 20m 30m options to
imediatly start without even opening the UI"; "can we hide the folders of the calendar and the timer on PC and Android";
"make the cards smaller on the desktop … 3 columns that get fewer when the window resizes"; "add a trash can to the top right
corner of the timer card and a pin at the top left. The UI will fit 9 timers"; "remove the recently used column … thats it a
clock with hands and the timer with play pause stop"; a sketch: the clock, HH and MM under it, Pause and Stop under those, a
line, the cards beside — "play is not needed as soon as I set a timer starts"; "why do we need an island on this applet?"

- [x] (timer session, 18 Oct) built on both sides; checked on emulator-5554 (tablet size and phone size) and the desktop in a
      hidden window (a scratch HOME); not on the user's tablet or phone, not between real devices.

### What it is
- **The screen**: the Calendar's clock (hours on the outer and inner ring, then minutes); **lifting the finger from the minutes
  starts the timer** (desktop: the minute hand let go, or Enter in a box); Pause/Resume and Stop under it act on the timer
  last started there (else the one ending first). The timers' cards beside it (desktop and tablet: three to a row, fewer as
  the window narrows; phone: two, above the clock), **nine at most**. Each card: the time left, Pause/Resume and Stop (OK when
  it rings); **a pin at the top left** keeps the card when it is stopped or done, ready to start again (▶ Start); **a trash at
  the top right** takes it away (a running one stops). No island, no drawer, no recently used list (all dropped by the user).
- **Home (Android)**: the Timer card with **6 · 15 · 20 · 30 min**, each starting at a tap, Tetra staying on Home.
- **Running**: Android — an ongoing notification per timer (Android's own countdown) with Pause/Resume + Stop, on a Xiaomi
  the **Hyper Island** counting down by itself with the same buttons (`HyperIsland.timer`: `sameWidthDigitInfo.timerInfo`,
  timerType −1 to the end, as the open-source HyperIsland ToolKit writes it); the end is an alarm clock (`setAlarmClock`, on
  time in Doze), then the alarm sound (USAGE_ALARM) and **OK**. Desktop — the system notification and a "Time's up · OK"
  bar with beeps on any page.
- **Folders hidden**: Calendar and Timer are not shown in Files' lists, search or Move on either side; they sync as before.

### The files (plain JSON, one per timer and device — Claude reads or starts a timer by writing one)
```
Tetra/Timer/                     (~/Tetra/Files/Timer on the PC, /sdcard/Tetra/Timer on a phone)
  k3f9a2.24091RPADG.json   {"id":"k3f9a2","seconds":300,"label":"","state":"running","ends":"2026-10-18T16:05:00Z","left":0,"rev":1,"by":"24091RPADG","pinned":false}
  k3f9a2.theologos-82xm.json   {"id":"k3f9a2",…,"state":"stopped","rev":2,"by":"theologos-82xm",…}   ← OK on the computer
```
- `state`: `running` (counts down to `ends`, an ISO instant) · `paused` (`left` seconds remain, `ends` null) · `stopped`.
  `pinned`: the card stays when stopped or done.
- **Written only at a change** — start, pause, resume, stop, OK, pin, delete: a handful of writes in a timer's life, never per
  second. Each device works out the time left from `ends` and its own clock, in memory.
- `rev` +1 at each change; the highest wins, equal ones stopped > paused > running (a pause and a stop at once: stopped). So
  clocks a few seconds apart decide nothing; they only show the time left a few seconds apart.
- **Each device writes only its own file** of a timer, `<id>.<device>.json` (the device = `by`, letters, digits, - and _ kept);
  all the files of an `id` are one timer, the highest `rev` among them wins. So two devices never change the same file and
  sync never keeps two versions side by side. (Until 18 Oct evening every device wrote the timer's one file; an OK on the PC
  and a start on the phone at once made `x (3) (3).json`, `x (3) (4).json`… — copies like these still read as the timer.)
- A new timer takes the `id` of one that is over and not pinned (`rev` + 1): the folder holds about as many files per device
  as there were timers at once. Ran out and nobody tapped OK: it rings 10 minutes at most, then is over.
- **Claude starts one** by writing `{"seconds":600,"state":"running","ends":"<now + 10 min, UTC>"}` as any `<name>.json` (the
  file name is the id when there is none); **stops one** by writing `<id>.json` with `"state":"stopped"` and `rev` one
  higher than the highest of its files.
- The clock opens on the length last started on that device (a local setting, not synced).

### How the devices keep in step
- A change is pushed at once: Android `ScopedSync.soon("timer", 0)` — Files sync's own requests for the part `timer`
  (DriveScope; desktop files.js SCOPES), as the Calendar's (SYNC_PLAN 6am); the computer's watcher on Files/Timer nudges every
  paired device (their SyncServer `/sync` → their own `timer` part at once). So a stop on the tablet reaches the phone through
  the computer within seconds.
- Fallback: a look every 30 s while a timer exists (Android TimerService; the desktop re-reads every 30 s); with Tetra closed
  on a phone, the Calendar's quarter-hourly look carries the Timer's part too. While ringing, a phone looks at once.
- Code: Android `Timer.kt` (record, files), `TimerService.kt` (TimerControl, the service, notifications, alarm),
  `TimerScreen.kt`, `HyperIsland.timer`, Home's card in MainActivity; desktop `timer.js`, `src/Timer.tsx` (the Calendar's
  `ClockFace` with `below`/`onDone`), main.js `timer:*`. Tests: Android `TimerTest` (9), desktop `test/timer.test.js` (9):
  time left, pause/resume, a stop/OK reaching the other device, two changes at once, clocks 3 s apart, a free file reused,
  pin and trash across devices, nine at most, a hand-written file.

### Alarms and stopwatch (the user, 29 Oct, relayed by the main session; branch `claude/timer-alarms`)
"ALARMS (at a clock time, optional repeat days and label, ring like a clock alarm even with the app closed) and a STOPWATCH";
"Show running timers, the stopwatch and the next alarm on Xiaomi's island — the island does not show them now"; files beside
the timers so they reach the tablet and PC; the skill and its helper; AI Assist ("βάλε ξυπνητήρι στις 7:30", "ξεκίνα χρονόμετρο").
- [x] (timer-alarms session, 29 Oct) Android: the Timer's tabs Timers · Alarms · Stopwatch (TimerAlarmsScreen.kt); files and
      rules in TimerAlarms.kt, the format in skills/tetra-timer/SKILL.md (`kind` alarm/stopwatch, states the timers' readers skip);
      TimerService rings alarms too (Snooze 10 min, Dismiss, AlarmRingActivity over the lock screen, 10 minutes unanswered then
      quiet) and shows the stopwatch (Android's chronometer, the island counting up); AlarmPlan sets the next alarm's alarm clock
      with the service idle (boot, clock, zone, update through CalendarAlarmReceiver) and from 12 h before shows it with Skip.
      **The island**: HyperOS gives the app in front none, and a timer started in Tetra was never posted again; now everything
      is posted again when Tetra leaves the front. AI Assist: alarm_add/list/delete, stopwatch. Tests: TimerAlarmsTest (6).
- [ ] Desktop (Drive desktop/): timer.js to read `kind` alarm/stopwatch, ring alarms, a stopwatch; its AI Assist the same tools.
- [ ] Seen on the phone: the island for a timer, the stopwatch and the next alarm (not checked: the phone was not on USB).
- [~] (clock-modal session, 30 Oct; main) The user, 30 Oct: "the clock takes too much space now with the island … the clock
      … opens in modal … a tick or an x"; "stand mode, for amoled, super low light clock … when charging"; "a notification when
      the alarm gets close 30 min before and ask if I want to skip or snooze"; "a skip next alarm button to alarms"; "when
      editing an alarm, add a set time button, show the clock on a modal … the time in a babble digitaly … the label at the
      top". Timers: the cards and Add new, the clock in DialDialog (✓ starts); the alarm editor: label, the time's bubble +
      Set time (the same DialDialog), the days. Alarms' cards: Skip next / Undo skip on a repeating one (`answered` ahead).
      AlarmPlan: from 30 min before, the notice pops up once (channel alarm_soon, no sound) with Skip and Snooze (Snooze
      before the ring: that ring answered, rings 10 min later); all in the file, so it syncs and outlives a reboot.
      Stand mode: StandDream, Android's screen saver (dim grey clock on black, the screen at its lowest, a step every
      minute); the Clock's moon button explains it and opens Android's Screen saver page, where the user picks it.
      Then (the user, same evening): "an Add new card … remove the limit of … 9 timers" (TimerFiles.MAX gone; the desktop's
      timer.js still has MAX = 9); the alarm's name on top of its card so Skip next fits; "Add new … and the buttons for the
      stop watch … above the island"; "on landscape and tablet make it a + next to the island like the contacts"; "dont use
      words add svgs" (round icons: +, play/pause, flag for Lap, refresh for Reset); stand mode's **sunrise**: 20 minutes
      before the next alarm (snoozes counted, a skip not) the screen goes deep red → orange → warm yellow and its brightness
      rises to full at the ring. Checked on the phone (portrait and landscape); the tablet not checked (not on USB).
      **Stand mode does not start by itself on the Xiaomi 15**: HyperOS never starts Android's screen saver on a timeout
      while charging (Always-on display on: its own doze screen; off: the screen goes dark); only Settings' preview shows
      it. Offered: the moon button starting the night clock itself; the user: "let it be" (30 Oct).

### Left
- [ ] The real pair: start on the tablet, pause on the PC, OK on the phone — on the user's tablet (971f6b37) once the main
      session says it is free; the island's look there (the emulator has no Hyper Island). The user: the sound works on the
      tablet with sync ("it works on sync with the tablet").
- [x] (18 Oct evening) "when I click ok on finished timer the other devices keep ringing": OK on the PC reached the phone in
      3 s (it stopped at 17:06:45) but never the tablet, which had lost the network after the reinstall (the PC heard nothing
      from it after 17:04:58; restarting the hotspot fixed it) — nothing can reach a device that is off the network. Found
      on the way: every change of a timer made sync copies of its one file; now each device writes its own file (above).
- [x] (19 Oct, the user: "We did not make a share with claude skill setting on Android or Desktop for the timer, we also did
      not add the timer to the togles for the individual apps for apearing in the launcher") A **tetra-timer skill**
      (skills/tetra-timer, zipped into the APK and copied into desktop/skills as the Calendar's); **Settings › Timer › Share
      with Claude** on Android (Share / Save to Files) and in the desktop Timer's own ⚙ at the top right, as the Calendar's (Save as… / Copy to ~/.claude/skills);
      **Timer in Settings › App icons** (Android; `.AppTimer`, its icon by hand from the vector glyph on Timer teal). The
      desktop has no launcher toggles for any part.
- [ ] Seen: Tetra already open does not turn to a part asked for by `adb am start -e …APPLET` (the Calendar's too); a
      notification's tap does. Not looked into.
- [ ] (18 Oct, the user: "Let be for now. write it down") **The tablet drops off the network after each reinstall** of
      Tetra: the PC stops hearing from it (17:04:58 that day) until the hotspot is restarted, so no stop, OK or change can
      reach it. To look into on the tablet itself (971f6b37) — the pairing/connection after an `adb install -r`.
- [ ] (same) **A 10 h 20 min timer started by itself** on the phone at 17:08:40 — most likely a stray touch on the clock while
      setting the minutes, since a timer starts the moment the finger lifts from the minutes. If it happens again: a Start
      button (or a confirm for long times) instead of starting on lift.
- [ ] (same) The fix above (72e9d0b / Drive b2e9561, pushed) is **not yet on the devices**: the PC's .deb is built
      (Drive/desktop/release/local-drive-desktop_0.6.0-beta.1_amd64.deb, the user installs it with sudo dpkg -i); the phone
      and tablet get the debug APK when connected. No GitHub release of 0.6.0 Beta 1 yet.

## Maps — dropped 20 Oct, restarted 21 Oct on branch `maps` (the user: "I changed my mind start buidlding the map applet")
The user, 21 Oct: "Have in mind that we may transfer this map to the desktop as well" — so the files stay plain and
shared: greece.pmtiles opens in MapLibre GL JS (pmtiles protocol) on the desktop as in MapLibre Android; routing and
search files built so both can read them. The size worry stands: the map is a file in Tetra/Maps, not in the APK.
The user, 20 Oct: "Greece as a map, offline, Map managment, Navigation, Turn nav voice, Import from Google Maps, Save loations
with SVGs and names, A home tab doeble the size, with slots for 6 locations". Decided 20 Oct: the **computer builds** the map
files and Tetra's sync carries them to the phone and tablet; routing for **car, walking and bike**.

Pieces (all free, no keys): the map is **Protomaps** (a Greece cut of their daily OSM build, one `.pmtiles` file, opened by the
MapLibre the app already has; style "light"/"dark" with Greek labels, fonts and sprites in assets/maps); routing **GraphHopper**
offline on the phone (Greek instructions); voice Android's **TextToSpeech** (el-GR); search an offline index of names/addresses
from Geofabrik's Greece OSM extract (accent-blind); icons **Maki** (CC0) + the user's own SVGs; import **Google Takeout**
(starred places have coordinates; list entries are name + link, found through the search, misses shown to fix).
Files: Tetra/Maps (hidden in Files like Calendar and Timer, synced): `greece.pmtiles` now; routing and search files later; saved
places as GeoJSON. License note: GraphHopper and AndroidSVG are Apache-2.0 beside the repo's GPL-2.0 (as other libraries already).

- [~] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) 1. Greece offline map (512 MB at zoom 15, region polygon), my location, map management (packages,
      size, date, delete to Trash); `tools/maps-greece.sh` makes the file on the computer.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) 2. Saved places (name, emblem, lists) as files; Home's Maps group double size with place slots; Google Takeout import.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) 3. Offline search, the bottom island, places' pages, lists (the user, 21 Oct: "an Island
      at the bottom with navigation,favorites, search … make lists with names and emojes … nearby lcations in an area like
      Google Maps … restorants and pharmases and supermarkets or petrol stations or charging stations add disability parking
      … button pills"; "If I click touch on a place there is no info page"; "To click on a spot show the address the number
      the postcode"; "the EOpYY farmacies … as a list as well as a pill"; schools "from kindengarden to Highschools"):
      tools/maps-places.py makes greece-places.tsv (122 834 towns and places of 22 kinds, with hours, phone, website,
      wheelchair) and greece-addresses.tsv (168 778 addresses); tools/maps-eopyy.py takes EOPYY's 39 pharmacies from
      eopyy.gov.gr (with their map positions). Search: words (accent-blind, Greek or English names) or a pill, nearest the
      map's middle first, as dots on the map; the user's accessible places count as disabled parking. Saved: all places by
      emblem, lists with a name and an emoji (long-press to change), EOPYY's list built in. Directions: Car/Walk(Roll)/Bike,
      "Where to?", Home's places and the car. A tap on the map: my place, a result, a place of the map's own (its page from
      the list), or a dropped pin with the nearest address; the page has the address, hours, phone, website, wheelchair,
      directions, Save (with lists), and Google Maps online for reviews and photos. Top left the road I am on with its code
      (EO1, A2), top right the next turn in a small window. Home's card 12 slots on a tablet (6 a row), 6 on a phone.
      Google Takeout import in Settings › Maps (lists' CSVs and starred places; unplaced ones listed). Not done: sch.gr's
      school register (its terms forbid reuse without permission; OSM's schools only, thin in places: 9 in Xanthi); Google
      Maps' data is not copied.
- [ ] 4. Routing (car, foot, bike), turn by turn, voice, the next turn in HyperIsland; reroute offline.
- [x] (22 Oct night) **Maps on desktop Tetra** (Drive desktop 0.6.0-beta.3, maps.js / router.js / src/Maps.tsx): the same files in
      Files/Maps, read and written as the phone writes them — the offline map (greece.pmtiles served as tiles through media://maps,
      the phone's light style, fonts and sprites), Search with the phone's pills (accent-blind, Greeklish, a kind in a named
      town, what is in view on Enter), a place's card (address, hours, phone, website, wheelchair, Nearby, Google Maps), saved
      places with the phone's emblems, Home slots 1–12 and lists, trips planned on the computer (A, B, C…) for the phone to drive,
      and directions by road on the computer: GraphHopper 10.2's server (Java 17 + ~/Tetra/.System/Maps/Tools/graphhopper-web-10.2.jar)
      on the phone's graph, memory-mapped read-only through a folder of links in the app's data, so no lock file reaches the
      synced greece-gh. Each leg's km and time (car × 1.2, as the phone), Car / Walk / Bike. Maps hidden in Files' lists.
- [ ] Later: the desktop app builds and refreshes the files monthly by itself; a `tetra-maps` skill; desktop directions
      without the computer's Java (a bundled runtime, ~50 MB) if another computer is to route.
- [x] (Drive 4e2ae56 + the Android commit beside this line; phone-location session, 23 Oct) Desktop Maps asks the phone where it is (the user, 21 Oct: "when I click the corent location or a rute is calculated it
      will ask the phone while showing Waiting phone for location … from the internet it will be off by half a county"):
      the computer sends a location request over the paired connection, the phone answers with one GPS fix (asking for the
      location permission if it has none); the desktop shows "Waiting for the phone's location…" meanwhile, and says so
      when the phone is not reachable. Built with desktop Maps.
      Built (SYNC_PLAN 6am): desktop Maps' where-I-am button (over the zoom buttons) and "Start from where I am" in a trip
      ask the paired phone (`POST /location`, phones before a tablet); the phone (PhoneLocation.kt) answers one fix — GPS,
      the network's only when GPS found nothing — asking for the permission on its screen if needed; in the background it
      posts "The computer asks where this phone is", and one tap sends it. The fix: a blue dot and a card, "Start a trip
      here (A)". Tried on the emulator against the desktop's own code (permission asked, fix in 8 s; background + tap,
      8.7 s); the desktop seen hidden with a stand-in phone. Not yet between the user's real phone and the installed
      /opt/Tetra (needs both new builds). Android freezes a backgrounded Tetra within about a minute: then only opening
      it on the phone helps, and the computer says so.
      On the user's phone (23 Oct, debug build, the new desktop code from source with the phone's real pairing): Tetra open,
      a GPS fix ±20 m in 4.3 s over Wi-Fi. Tetra in the background (5 s or 35 s after Home): no answer at all — the
      phone's network policy shows Tetra `blocked=APP_BACKGROUND`, so the computer says "No phone answered. Open Tetra on
      the phone". The notification path only works while something keeps Tetra out of the cached state (a running timer's
      service), and on the emulator.
- [x] (the commit beside this line, 23 Oct) Desktop Maps' where-I-am with the phone in a pocket: Android cuts a backgrounded Tetra off the network within ~5 s
      (above), so the phone can answer only while Tetra is open. Needs a decision from the user: Tetra on the phone keeps
      listening in the background (a foreground service with its own small notification while paired with a computer;
      it would also let the computer's "sync now" reach a pocketed phone), or it stays "open Tetra to answer" as now.
      Not a test: a design change (SyncServer's "nothing listens once the app is closed" rule, SYNC_PLAN 6i).
      The user, 23 Oct: "we had such a rule ok change it". Built: SyncListenService, a foreground service while a computer
      is paired (started when Tetra opens, after pairing, after a restart or an update; Settings › Sync › Listen in the
      background turns it off, as does Stop on its notification, which is the quietest kind: only Android's services
      indicator). Started from the open app with the location allowed it also holds the location right, so the phone
      answers without a tap. On the user's phone: Tetra closed 40 s, a GPS fix ±7 m in 7.5 s; the user saw only the
      services indicator, and the location pointer when the computer asked. Phone locked (screen off): ±10 m in 5.8 s.
      Not tried: deep Doze (the phone was on USB, so charging, which keeps Doze away) and a day's battery; Tetra is
      locked in MIUI's recents on the user's phone, so the battery saver should not stop it there.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Nearby (the user: "πατάω αναζήτηση πατάω πύργο και βγάζει την καρτέλα … βάλε και ένα κουμπί
      Nearby και βγάλε σημεία ενιδαφέροντος"): a place's card › Nearby opens Search around it ("Near Πύργος"), nearest first,
      distances from it, the pills narrowing it. Search's panel now rides above the keyboard, and says it is loading.
      The user's work schools put in by hand (Places/sch-*.json, list Work 💼, Home slots 1–5): Πύργος and Σκάλα at the
      village's middle (no school in OSM there), the 2nd of Κρεώνα at the user's link, the 1st
      of Κρεώνα (not a work one) at the village's middle.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Motorways (the user: "έκανες κανένα τέστ σε εγνατία οδό … σε 3χμ πάρτη την έξοδο στα δεξιά";
      "Κάνε και Σχιματάρι Ναυπλιο"): tried Καβάλα → Ξάνθη and Σχηματάρι → Ναύπλιο on the graph. The exits say "μείνετε
      δεξιά … προς Εύλαλο, Τοξότες" (OSM's destination signs) and "πάρτε τον δρόμο Α7 προς Τρίπολη"; a turn onto a nameless
      ramp now says where it leads ("στρίψτε αριστερά προς Α8 Αθήνα - Πάτρα", from the path's street_name/ref); the spoken
      warnings follow the speed (dueWarning: 2 km ahead over 80 km/h, ~20 s ahead, ~5 s ahead; "Σε 2 χιλιόμετρα, …").
      Not there: lanes (below), exit numbers, the word "έξοδος", tolls. GraphHopper chose the Θηβών–Ελευσίνας road over the
      Αθηνών–Λαμίας + Αττική Οδός for Σχηματάρι → Ναύπλιο (shorter; to be judged by the user on the road).
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Ways to choose (the user, beside Google Maps on the tablet: "can our map have alternative
      routs with tolls or without, main roads over roral roads"): a place's Car / Walk / Bike shows up to three routes
      (GraphHopper's alternative_route on the CH graph), fastest first, each with its time, length and roads (Motorway / Main
      roads / Local roads, by share of length; tracks dropped for a car); Start goes by the chosen one; Home's one tap still
      starts the fastest at once. Άγιος Λουκάς → 2ο Κρεώνα: 23 min motorway / 25 min local roads (Google: 30 tolls / 31 none).
      Also: the speed limit as its sign bottom left, red over it by 3 km/h (OSM maxspeed in the graph, 71–89 % of the roads
      tried); the ferry said as a ferry; the user's schools as system places (added-places.tsv, drawn on the map, in Search)
      with Home names (Place.label); 8 half-size Home slots on a phone; P and where-I-am at the bottom right (the compass);
      Greeklish search; Google Takeout in Greek (Αποθηκευμένα, Χάρτες (τα μέρη σας), Μέρη με ετικέτα), streamed, links'
      ?q= positions, addresses looked up in the address list in the right town: the user's first Takeout part gave 53 of 65.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) More of the user's asks the same evening: a narrow screen's one pill (the road over the next
      turn), no Back in directions; toll stations (OSM's 255 barrier=toll_booth, with operator and price where tagged) as
      € dots on the route, counted on each route to choose ("💶 n", "No tolls" only for local roads: OSM misses some ramp
      tolls, as Νέα Οδός' near Σχηματάρι), and under a handle on the directions bar with the turns ahead; a kind with a town's
      name searched in that town ("agios loukas" + Supermarkets); mini markets under Supermarkets; the cities' own ΑμεΑ
      spots from data.gov.gr (tools/maps-amea.py: 740 — Θεσσαλονίκη, Χανιά, Παπάγου-Χολαργός, Αθήνα, Χαλάνδρι, Νάξος; Λάρισα's
      and Ηράκλειο's only as shapefile/document, not read); "Add to the map" (a long press: My place / On the map with its
      kind, added-places.tsv, removable from its card); Export / Import as GeoJSON (my places, map additions or both).
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Tunnels (the user: "What if I loose GPS sygnal on a tannel"): 3 s without a GPS fix in
      directions at speed, the arrow goes on along the route at the last speed (≤10 km), "No GPS signal" shown; a cell fix
      does not stand for the GPS for 2 min after it; the first GPS fix takes over. Tried on the emulator with location off
      for 8 s at 107 km/h: it went on and said the next turn, then took the real fix back. Then (the user: "μπορεί για 5
      λεπτά να μην έχω GPS … να χρησιμοποιεί τους αισθητήρες"): up to 15 min or the route's end (no 10 km cap); the
      accelerometer (StillDetector: the spread of linear acceleration over 2 s) holds the arrow while the car stands, and
      after a stop it goes on at 30 km/h (or less). Emulator, sensors set by hand: on, held, on again. Not tried in a tunnel.
      Markers (the user: "my personal keep our style what I save as public info gets the maps own style"): search results
      and map additions in the map's own icon style (its sprite for restaurant, café, supermarket, school…, the rest drawn
      as it draws them); my places keep Maps' indigo circle with their emblem. A tavern emblem.
      ATMs (the user: "Can we find a map of all the ATMs in greece"): no open per-ATM list found (the banks' union publishes
      counts only, ~6 000); OSM has 3 405, all in Search's ATMs pill.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Search's OK (the user: "να πατάω απλά ρεστοράντ και να πατάω οκ και να βγάζει τα ρεστοράντ σε
      αυτό το κομάτι που βλέπω … ή και λίγο μεγαλήτερο"): a pill or words, then OK (or the keyboard's search key): up to 300
      of them on the screen and half a screen round it stay on the map, the panel goes, a "🍽️ Restaurants · n ✕" pill clears
      them; none there: the nearest 20, the map moved to them.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) ΑμεΑ spots by the user himself (none in any data for Καβάλα or Ξάνθη): after parking (P or
      a car trip's end) "♿ ΑμεΑ spot? Add it" for 20 s puts one at the car's GPS spot; a long press's dialog has "♿ ΑμεΑ
      parking here" at the top, one tap. Not done: looking for them by eye in Google's imagery (its terms forbid taking data
      from it; its satellite pictures too coarse with cars on the spots, 21 Oct). Mapillary's street photos (CC-BY-SA) and
      their detected signs could give them lawfully; needs a Mapillary token (the user's account).
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct night) ΑμεΑ spots from Διαύγεια, all of Greece (tools/maps-diavgeia.py; the user: "Continue the
      same way for all over Greece add what are you are serten of and I will check (give links) the rest"): 6 061 decisions
      2012–2026; 5 740 left out (a spot given to one person or car — most of them —, requests, abolitions, regions' reviews);
      2 placed for sure by address (greece-amea-diavgeia.tsv: Βόλος, Ξάνθη); 223 public ones to place by hand
      (greece-amea-check.tsv: Ξάνθη 49, Βόλος 37, Μυτιλήνη 19, Ρέθυμνο 13, Πειραιάς 12 …), 129 of them at their street
      (greece-streets.tsv, 212 167 named road pieces), 94 at the town. In the app: Saved › "♿ ΑμεΑ to place (n)", nearest
      first; a tap shows the street and the decision; a long press places it (a map addition with the decision's link),
      "Not there" drops it; amea-checked.txt keeps the done ones on every device. OSM has too few house numbers to do more.
      Also: favourites' markers at 22 dp (were 28); car times ×1.2 (Άγιος Λουκάς → Χαλκίδα 30 min); routing errors in
      plain words; map additions shown at once (a bug: they waited for a reopen); an edge-case route battery (MapsEdgeCaseTest:
      ferries, bridges, islands, mountains, one-ways, outside Greece, at sea — no crash, sensible times). The user's Takeout:
      18 favourites given their emblem (beaches, cafés, parkings, doctors…), 4 public additions (2 ΑμεΑ spots in Ναύπλιο,
      Παραλία Δρεπάνου, River Cafe, a parking in Ξάνθη) — waiting for a device on USB (scratchpad emblems/, public-additions.tsv).
- [x] (maps-link session, 22 Oct) More ΑμεΑ sources (the user, from Gemini: OSM/Overpass, the open data portals, open aerial
      imagery): OSM holds ~290 tagged ΑμεΑ spots in all of Greece (parking_space=disabled, capacity:disabled, wheelchair on
      parkings) — the list already had most; data.gov.gr searched with more words: + Κερατσίνι–Δραπετσώνα (173, WFS),
      Ηράκλειο (79, CSV in cp1253 with "35.337.201" numbers), Λάρισα (49 general spots, a shapefile in ΕΓΣΑ87, converted
      in maps-amea.py), Νάξος' signs (1): greece-amea.tsv 740 → 1 031. Aerial: Esri World Imagery (free, allowed for
      mapping) is 0.45 m/px in Ξάνθη — a parking space is 5 pixels, its paint unseen; not a source.
- [ ] Tolls: GraphHopper's toll encoded value is not in the graph; with it (a rebuild) a "no tolls" profile, and the routes
      marked with tolls. The user stopped a rebuild on 21 Oct (distance influence 30 for the car); to be asked again.
- [ ] Lane guidance (the user, 21 Oct: "where there are alot of laines does it tell you show you at the corner what lane
      you should take - keep?"): now only GraphHopper's keep left/right at forks. GraphHopper 10 keeps no lanes, so the
      computer's build reads OSM's turn:lanes tags itself (a pass over greece-latest.osm.pbf beside the graph, by way id),
      and the phone draws the lanes under the next turn, the ones to take lit.
- [ ] Map Update from the computer (the user, 21 Oct: "a map updater in the app settings in the applets section and a map
      managment to downlad or update a map"): Settings › Maps shows what is installed (done, 21 Oct) and how updates come;
      the Update button asks desktop Tetra to run the build (tools/maps-greece.sh's steps) and sync brings the files —
      with desktop Maps. More regions than Greece then too (the same script with another Geofabrik extract).
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Parking (the user, 21 Oct: "save park location button, when user stops or and when the
      Android auto turns off … save automaticaly and have the map start from location to that parking spot automaticaly at
      the next open. Option in settings. The parking spot resets at the next car moveon not legs or bike, based on speed or
      car bluetooth"): the map's P button; Settings › Maps › Save where I park (on: the end or Stop of a car trip saves it)
      and Open the map at my car (directions on foot to it at the next open); cleared by a new car trip or 3 fixes over
      40 km/h. One place, Places/parking.json ("My car"), so it syncs and shows like the others.
- [ ] Parking from the car's Bluetooth and Android Auto: saved when the car's Bluetooth (chosen in Settings) or Android
      Auto disconnects, cleared when it connects again. Needs "Allow all the time" location (the app is in the background
      then) and BLUETOOTH_CONNECT; with Android Auto.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Rolling (the user: "diferent modes on the map? Walking/Rolling"; "Add it as an option in
      the settings Walking to be changed the icon to rolling"): Settings › Maps › On foot: Walking / Rolling; Rolling routes
      with the graph's wheelchair profile (maps-graph.yml: foot.json without steps or hike/mtb-rated paths, ≤ 4 km/h) and
      shows the wheelchair icon. A graph from before it falls back to walking.
- [ ] Public transport (the user: "public trasport (can we have that are there info about bases or trains or ships…)"):
      GraphHopper's GTFS module routes on timetables. Open feeds: Athens OASA (buses, trolleys) and STASY (metro, tram);
      Thessaloniki OASTH to check; Hellenic Train and ferries have no open feed (ferries: none known). Offline on the phone
      it needs GraphHopper's PT graph built on the computer like the road one; a big piece, after the road directions.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) The map light or dark, apart from the app (the user: "add in the settings a separate
      togle for dark and light theme, because I dont like the dark theme on the map"): Settings › Maps › Map, light by default.
- [~] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Tetra in light (the user, 21 Oct: "after that we sould check every page and polise the
      light theme of the android app and make it an option light or dark"): Settings › Appearance › Theme Dark / Light
      (TetraLook; dark by default), a light palette (TetraLightColors), status-bar icons that follow it; Home's Scanner/Codes
      cards and tile icons, and the page headers (ModuleHeader) fixed for light. Checked on the emulator in light: Home,
      Files, Notes, Calendar (and its event editor), Timer, Text editor, Settings, Sync, Office's start page, Maps. The
      floating dark-glass islands stay dark in both. Not yet: Office's editors (Words, Tables, Slides, PDF) keep their dark
      frame and ribbon in light — their own colours, a pass of their own; Photos with photos in it; the phone size.
- [~] Android Auto (the user, 21 Oct: "Can it work with Android auto?"; 22 Oct: "its not on the list of the available
      Apps can we add it?"): MapsCar.kt, built 22 Oct — androidx.car.app 1.4 navigation app: the map on the car's surface
      (a MapView in a Presentation on a VirtualDisplay), Places (Home's first, then nearest), Nearby (ΑμεΑ parking, fuel,
      EV, parking, pharmacies, EOPYY, supermarkets, toilets, hospitals), car directions with the phone's guidance and voice
      (ducking the music), parking saved when Android Auto disconnects. Android Auto lists a sideloaded navigation app only
      with its Developer settings › Unknown sources on. Seen 22 Oct on the desktop head unit through the user's phone
      (Start head unit server, adb forward tcp:5277; DHU needs libc++1 and an open stdin), full screen and beside Spotify:
      zoom (+/−, pinch), pan and back to me; the speed-limit sign drawn on the map (the user: "where is the speed limit?").
      Places on the map (22 Oct, replacing a GridTemplate start page that left the small card blank): with no directions
      the big side shows cards over the dimmed map — the phone Home's 8, Favourites (all the other saved ones), Nearby, the
      recent destinations not saved (MapsPrefs.recent, phone and car) — tapped through SurfaceCallback.onClick; Map hides
      them, a tap on the map drops a pin (Go / ✕); Search (as you type, parked). The small card is told apart by the visible
      area lying on one side of the surface's middle (the surface is always the whole screen). The column goes to the
      driver's side by the network's country (right where traffic keeps left). On the map a column
      with no background — speed, the limit's sign, "€ Tolls n" lit while the route has tolls ahead, "No GPS" after 10 s
      without a fix — and ⚙ Voice: every direction / important only (wrong way, new route, no GPS, arrival) / off.
      Sizes follow the car screen (the column a hundredth of its height per unit, at the driver's side, left). The small
      card (beside Spotify): with directions the next turn only, big (arrow, distance, street) and the limit; without, the
      Home's 8 places 2 by 4 (Android Auto opens Tetra on a tap there, so they show and do not start a route). The graph is
      opened as the car connects (the first route took 25 s).
      Phone and car one trip (CarLink, 22 Oct): with the car connected a place picked on the phone starts on the car's
      screen and the phone shows those directions with Stop. In directions the arrival card holds End, Routes (up to 3, with
      tolls), Stop (a place on the way, then on), and Parking — only when the destination has ΑμεΑ spots within Settings ›
      Maps' distance (500 m–2 km), said ~1.5 km before. Tolls: "€ n" in the arrival card, said at the start and ~1 km
      before each, € dots on the route.
- [x] Trips (22 Oct; the user: "a plan mode for the phone … how many stops … point to the 1st stop, the second … saved as
      a trip … start automaticaly for the next A B C D"): Directions › Plan a trip asks how many (2–10), then each stop in
      turn (map tap, Search or Saved → "➕ Stop B"), lettered on the map; Save / Save and go. Files in Tetra/Maps/Trips. A
      stop reached: the next leg starts when the car moves on (15 km/h or 150 m), kept 12 h in MapsPrefs.pendingTrip so it
      survives the engine off; with the car connected the trip runs on its screen (Trips among the car's cards too).
      For the drive (23 Oct): the speed column, € Tolls, wrong way and No GPS while moving; the voice over the car's speakers
      and the important-only mode; how the user's car shows the small card (an ✕ there if it fits); updateTrip for the
      cluster/HUD; the map dark at night (carContext.isDarkMode) — the user prefers the light map, ask; lanes.
      Not in the car: alternative routes, the tunnel's dead reckoning.
- [x] (maps-link session, 21 Oct) Emblems in tabs (the user, 21 Oct: "Add more emblims for pharmases, hospitals,
      relatives travel locations, nature like waterfalls rivers beaches and have them in tabs with categories"): General,
      People, Health, Travel, Nature (26 emblems) in the place dialog, and the saved-places list in the same tabs; the
      accessible (wheelchair) mark in General and beside Parking (the user: "a disability mark to have for my parking spots
      and accessible places").

## PDF — from viewer to editor (planned and built 22 Oct; what is left at the end of this section)

The user, 22 Oct: "make our PDF viewer a PDF editor … parity with PDF Craft"; "I dont want to copy their code I want you to see
the futures … as a roadmap"; "I have no intension to ever taking money from the things i make, software is born free and it
sould stay that way". So: PdfCraft (github.com/storytold/pdfcraft, v0.11 alpha, Rust, desktop/web only, ~170 tools) is the
feature checklist only — none of its code. The engine is **MuPDF** (AGPL-3.0, fine for a free app; Tetra's LICENSE says GPL-2.0
with no version, so "GPL-3.0-or-later" should be stated — the user's call).

Why an engine at all: today's viewer (PdfScreen.kt) uses Android's PdfRenderer, which does not draw annotations — a PDF with
highlights, notes, ink, stamps and arrows showed only its text (emulator, 22 Oct). MuPDF draws them all, edits them, does pages,
forms, true redaction, passwords, compression; minSdk 30 stays. Size: AAR 21.6 MB for 4 ABIs (~5.4 MB compressed per ABI);
measured in Tetra's APK before Phase 1 is committed (today arm64 release 159 MB). Fallback if ever needed: PDFium + PdfBox-Android.

Under Office's rules: opens view-only with Words' Edit; tabs File · Home · Review · Draw · Pages · Fill & Sign · Insert · Forms ·
Protect · View (+ Image, Comment when chosen); everyday on the ribbon with icons, the rest behind ⋯; tablet/phone strips with
✓/×, modals for many fields; Words' parts reused (Swatches, DesignGalleryStrip fonts, SizeStepper, Draw tab for ink and
signatures, FindReplaceBar, Versions, AutoSave); incremental save keeps the original bytes; Greek text boxes embed a real font.

- [x] (22 Oct) MuPDF in (com.artifex.mupdf:fitz 1.28.5, ~11 MB native per ABI): a file's comments drawn, Find/Copy on every
      Android, password asked. Edit (view only first, as Words): Pages — Organize (the scanner's ReorderGrid, shared), rotate,
      delete, blank page, insert another PDF, extract a page; Review — highlight/underline/strikethrough over the words a
      finger crosses, notes (written; tapped to read), rectangle, oval, arrow, colour (Words' Swatches), delete a comment;
      Draw — pen, highlighter, widths; Fill & Sign — text (Greek: MuPDF's URW fonts; long dashes made plain), tick, cross,
      dot, date, a signature drawn once in Words' DrawDialog (kept in the app) placed by a tap; a form's own fields filled
      by tapping them (text, boxes, round buttons, lists; Edit comes on by itself). Undo/redo (MuPDF's journal), Save
      appending to the bytes as opened (incremental; Versions kept), Save or not on leaving. Emulator-checked each.
      Not yet: text boxes with a box/colour, own stamps, the comments pane, bookmarks, Insert, Protect, phone layout check.
- [~] Phase 0 (1–2 days, no library): superseded by MuPDF — highlights/notes/text boxes/stamps shown on API 35+ (RenderParams flags), Find and copy
      on Android 12–14 (PdfRendererPreV), password-protected files (LoadParams).
- [x] Phases 1–3 and most of 4 built 22 Oct (emulator-checked; see git log): every annotation drawn and edited; Pages; Review
      with the Comments pane (replies) and Bookmarks; Draw; Fill & Sign (forms filled and made: text field, check box); Insert
      (text box, picture, own and standard stamps, header & footer, watermark); Protect (password, find & redact, select &
      redact — the text removed from the file, checked with pymupdf); Reduce size; OCR (Tesseract, Greek + English, an invisible
      text layer); Export text; Edit in Words (colours, lists, pictures, tables found after the fact, contents → Words' TOC).
- [ ] Left: cover-and-retype for a PDF's own text; digital (certificate) signatures (~6 MB of crypto); remove hidden
      information; document properties; a placed signature moved afterwards; Edit in Words sometimes misses a table's header
      row; the phone layout checked; all of it on the real pair (phone 208c8192, tablet 971f6b37).
- [x] (pdf-new session, 24 Oct; branch claude/pdf-new) The user: "Open PDFs" showed only images — it was Office's PDF card, whose
      New was "New from photos" (Android's photo picker); Home's Open PDFs tile already lists PDFs only. Now the card's New is
      "New PDF" with a menu: Blank page (A4) — `Pdf.newBlank`, "New PDF (n).pdf" in Documents, opened editing (JustMade, as
      Slides) — and From photos. PdfNewDeviceTest (blank, text, page, saved, reopened). Desktop: none, by scope (22 Oct).
      The "Page X of Y" pill now only while viewing, as Words' (the user: it sat on the page while editing). Emulator, tablet
      and phone sizes; not yet on the real pair.
- [x] (pdf-new session, 24 Oct; branch claude/pdf-new) The user: "text input fonts format like in Words, Slides and Tables?" —
      Fill & Sign › Text and Review › Text box are typed on the page itself, with Words' Home tools in the ribbon's place (as a
      Slides box: one look for the whole text): Font (Words' strip, phone fonts too), size, B/I/U, colour, highlight,
      alignment, × and ✓; a tap off the words or Back puts them on. Written as a text annotation whose look is Android's
      layout with the font embedded (PdfText.kt; Poppler draws it the same), its words in it for other readers, its look in
      the annotation's own key so a tap types it in again. PdfTextDeviceTest. Not yet: a look per word (Slides' isn't
      either), moving a placed text, the real pair.
      Then (the user on the tablet, 24 Oct: "how do I move the text box?", "look how Words, Slides and Tables work"): as a
      Slides box — a tap chooses a text (frame and corner handle), a second tap or Edit text types in it, a finger drags it,
      the handle sizes it (a text sized keeps that width); its tab: the look at once (one undo step each), Fill and
      Border, Position (Word's Align: left, centre, right, top, middle, bottom, 2 cm from the edge), Delete; keys as
      Slides' — Delete, arrows (Shift: 10 pt), Enter, Esc, Ctrl+S/Z/Y; the typed words' selection blue on the page (dark
      theme: Ctrl+A's selection did not show). Emulator, tablet size.
      Then ("dont stop, is anything else missing?"): Slides' item tools for a chosen text — Cut, Copy, Paste (Copy's text
      a little lower and right; else words copied in another app, a new text), Duplicate (Ctrl+D), Arrange (bring
      forward/to front, send backward/to back among the page's comments, pictures and drawings: the /Annots order),
      Rotate (90° steps, the look turned in the file), Format painter, Clear formatting; a mouse's right button: Edit
      text, Cut, Copy, Paste (where clicked), Bring to front, Send to back, Delete; Ctrl+C/X/V. PdfTextDeviceTest
      turnedAndRestacked. Emulator: tablet and phone sizes. Not done: "behind" the page's own text (a comment always
      sits over it; behind needs writing into the page itself, and it could no longer be chosen), a look per word,
      the right button tried with a real mouse.
      Then ("ok go on"): any angle — a handle over the chosen frame turns it about its middle (near a quarter turn it
      snaps to it), as Slides'; the file keeps its own size before turning (laidW/laidH), its place the box round it.
      A slanted text keeps its size (Rotate › Upright to size it). Emulator, tablet size; PdfTextDeviceTest at 30°.
      Then ("go on finish and then will test"): words with their own look — typed in Words' editor (RichTextState);
      with words selected, B I U, text colour and highlight go on those words only (nothing selected: the whole text);
      kept as runs beside the words and look, drawn with the font's own faces; font and size stay the whole text's (as a
      Slides box). The turning handle goes under the frame at the page's top; a turn counts from where the finger took
      hold. PdfTextDeviceTest wordsWithTheirOwnLook (a red bold word drawn red, the other line black). Emulator, tablet.
      Left for the user's test: the right button with the tablet's mouse (adb cannot send one). Left out: behind the
      page's own text; a size or font for some words only.
      Then (the user: "the right click … is in a selection tab for phone and tablet and in a menu for a desktop view — do
      you have the same layout?"): now as Slides' — a text chosen adds Selection first (Cut, Copy, Paste, Paste text
      only, Copy formatting, Paste formatting) and its own tab last, "Text box", in the lighter colour (Edit text, the
      look, Clear formatting, Position, Arrange, Rotate, Duplicate, Delete); the other tabs stay; choosing a text shows
      its tab, letting it go shows the tab before; the right button's menu as before. The Format painter became Copy /
      Paste formatting. Emulator, tablet size.
      Then (the user: "its not even close, page layout and stuff — take a look on what the other applets have"): Words'
      tabs in Words' order — File (Save, Save a copy, AutoSave, Save as, Rename, Versions, Edit in Words, Export text,
      Print, Share, Open in another app, About this file, Send log, Settings), Home (Text, Text box, the look of the chosen
      text or the next one), Insert (Blank page, Insert PDF, Text, Text box, Picture, Signature, Stamp, Rectangle, Oval,
      Arrow, Note, Date, Page numbers, Header & footer, Watermark), Draw, Layout (Size: A4/A5/A3/Letter/Legal, Portrait,
      Landscape — every page, its top left kept; Margins: Word's presets, used by Position and a new text; Blank/Delete
      page, Rotate), Pages, Review, Fill & Sign, Protect, View (Navigation, Comments, Bookmarks, Zoom − % +, Fit width,
      Two pages, Ruler on a tablet, cm/inches) — and Words' rulers along the top and down each page. Save a copy leaves
      the file unsaved (a redaction still to do stays to do). PdfNewDeviceTest pageSizeAndWayRound. A second emulator
      (books_tablet, read-only) while another session used the first. Not done: Design (page colour, borders).
- [x] (pdf-handles session, 25 Oct; branch claude/pdf-handles) The user after trying it: the chosen text's handles are
      Slides' (a dot 9 dp at the corner, reached within 28 dp; the turn's dot on a stalk), handled on the page before its
      own taps as Slides' are; Text box › arrows ← → ↑ ↓ beside Position — a tap a point, held it goes on and faster, put
      on when let go (one Undo); Review's and Draw's colours are Words' (white among them, More… Words' table). The eraser
      (Delete comment) takes strokes saved in an earlier session too (they are annotations in the file): PdfNewDeviceTest
      eraserTakesAStrokeSavedBefore. Not covered: drawings that are the page's own content (another app's, flattened) —
      a white pen or a white-filled box covers those; real removal would need the page's content edited.
      Then ("everything as in Words … when I press it with the mouse or the finger, it is to move it"): a text pressed
      and dragged moves at once, chosen if it was not; a tap chooses it, a tap on the chosen one types in it; Words' own
      handles (ObjectHandles: corner and sides stretch, the knob on its stem turns) and Words' blue outline, turned with
      it; Position stays a menu (Word's Align), the arrows beside it. Emulator (tablet, dark).
- Left out: JavaScript, XFA, PDF/A, measuring, compare, Bates numbering, Action Wizard, accessibility tagging, layers.
- Desktop Tetra later: MuPDF's npm build (WASM) or pdfcraft-cli as a backend; the edit list and this ribbon spec shared.
  PdfCraft can be the reference to compare pages against, as LibreOffice is for Words.

## Contacts — the next applet (planned 23 Oct by the contacts-plan session; nothing built until the user agrees)

**The user, 23 Oct (in Greek, relayed):** a Contacts applet: what Google Contacts has, Tetra's own way; the photo from the
faces Photos already finds; each birthday an event in the right calendar (now: move the birthdays out of Google
Contacts); synced to the desktop and the storage drive by itself; the classic island; the contact page like the
iPhone's (round photo, name, round Message/Call/Video/Mail buttons, Details | Voicemail, the last call, Call history);
on the tablet's Home, Maps shrinks to one card so Contacts fits; a brown colour; the two new icons; Viber, Revolut and
other apps. Free software: Google's and Apple's apps are feature lists only.

### What Google Contacts has (checked 23 Oct) → what Tetra's has
| Google Contacts | Tetra |
|---|---|
| Name: prefix, first, middle, last, suffix, phonetic, nickname, "file as" | the same (N, FN, NICKNAME, X-PHONETIC-*); sort by first or last name (setting) |
| Company, job title, department | the same (ORG, TITLE) |
| Phones, emails, addresses, websites, chat/SIP — each with a label (Mobile, Home, Work, custom) | the same, labels as Google writes them (TYPE, or `itemN.X-ABLabel` for custom ones) |
| Birthday (year optional), significant dates (Anniversary, custom) | the same; each becomes a yearly event in a calendar (below) |
| Related people (Spouse, Mother, Child, custom) | the same (`itemN.X-ABRELATEDNAMES`); a related name that is a contact opens it |
| Custom fields, notes | the same (NOTE; custom fields as Google's X- lines, kept) |
| Labels (groups), one contact in many | the same — `CATEGORIES`, so not folders (a contact can be in several) |
| Starred (favourites) | Favourites (Google writes `starred` in CATEGORIES; Tetra the same, so it round-trips) |
| Photo | from Photos' faces (below), or any photo cropped, or the imported one |
| Merge & fix: suggested duplicates (same name/phone/email), merge one or all, dismiss | the same; a dismissed pair stays dismissed on every device |
| Import vCard / CSV; export Google CSV, Outlook CSV, vCard (all, starred, a label) | import vCard 2.1/3.0/4.0 (Samsung's, Google's, Apple's), Google CSV, a Takeout zip, the phone's own contacts; export vCard (all, favourites, a label) |
| Trash (30 days), "Undo changes" (back to a time) | Tetra's Trash (moving the file), Files' version history for a file |
| "Other contacts" (people you e-mailed), contact sharing from Gmail | no (Tetra reads no mail) |
| Google Takeout › Contacts: a zip, one .vcf per label (`All Contacts/All Contacts.vcf`) | read as a zip: labels from the folder names and CATEGORIES |

Not doing: Google's account sync or API (no sign-in, nothing online), directory/workspace contacts, "Other contacts".
Seen in the user's own exports (only field names counted): Samsung's two (vCard 2.1, 242 contacts each, 54/115 photos
inline, `X-SAMSUNGADR`, birthdays `YYYY-MM-DD`) and Google's (vCard 3.0, 198 contacts, labels in CATEGORIES, custom labels
as `itemN.X-ABLabel`, photos as googleusercontent links, birthdays `YYYYMMDD`). The importer must read all of these.

### The files (the Calendar's way: one file per contact, plain, any AI can edit)
```
Tetra/Contacts/                        (~/Tetra/Files/Contacts on the PC, /sdcard/Tetra/Contacts on a phone)
  maria-papadopoulou-3f9a2c.vcf        one contact = one vCard; the file name means nothing, the UID inside is the identity
  dentist-81be07.vcf
```
- **vCard 3.0** (RFC 2426) — what Google and Apple export and Android's own importer takes; a year-less birthday as
  `BDAY:--10-23` (vCard 4's form; Google and Apple read it). Read forgiving: 2.1 (QUOTED-PRINTABLE, CHARSET), 3.0, 4.0,
  `YYYYMMDD`, Apple's `1604-` year. Write strict (CRLF, folded at 75). **Lines Tetra does not understand are kept as
  they were** (the Calendar's rule): an edit changes only its lines.
- Tetra's own lines: `UID`, `REV` (last change, for "the newer of two versions"), `X-TETRA-PERSON:<Photos person uuid>`
  (the face the photo came from), `X-TETRA-NOT-DUPLICATE:<other UID>` (a dismissed merge suggestion).
- **The photo inside the file** (`PHOTO;ENCODING=b;TYPE=JPEG:`, 512 px square, ~40 KB): the contact stays one file that
  any app imports with its face; 250 contacts ≈ 10 MB. (A photo beside the file would be two files to keep in step.)
- New file name: the name plus six letters of the UID's hash, never renamed (Calendar's rule). Delete = move to
  `Tetra/Trash/` (never rm; SYNC_PLAN 6an). Two versions after a sync (`x (2).vcf`, same UID): shown as one, the newer
  REV, with "2 versions · Keep this one", as the Calendar does.
- No folders inside: labels are CATEGORIES, not folders (a contact is often in two). `Contacts` becomes a required
  folder like `Calendar` and is hidden in Files (as the Calendar's and Timer's are) — or shown (question 3).

### Sync — desktop and the storage drive, by itself
- **Later** (the user, 23 Oct: "keep the sync for later so we dont have conflicts"): the Contacts builder touches no
  sync code (DriveFiles.kt's DriveScope, Sync*.kt, desktop sync.js/files.js) until the send-to-computer work is in.
- **Nothing new to build for the files**: Files sync already carries everything under Tetra. As the Calendar: a
  scope `contacts` = `Contacts/` + the Trash's `.vcf` — one line in `DriveScope` (DriveFiles.kt) and one in the
  desktop's `files.js SCOPES` — and `ScopedSync.soon(context, "contacts", …)` after every save, so a change is on the
  other devices in seconds (SYNC_PLAN 6am), deletions followed into Trash (6an).
- **The storage drive (T7-TEO)**: the desktop's backup to a drive already copies Drive's files when the drive's rule has
  "Files" on (sync.js backUpToDrive) — Contacts go with them, nothing to build. To check with the user: that rule is on.
- The phone's system contacts (below) are a copy made from the files, never synced themselves.

### Birthdays (and other dates) into the right calendar
- **The contact is the truth; the event follows it.** Settings › Contacts › "Birthdays go into": a calendar, by default
  `Γενέθλια` (the one with that name or "Birthdays"; asked once if neither). Anniversaries/other dates: the same
  calendar, or another (setting).
- Each birthday = one `.ics` in that calendar, written by Contacts: all day, `RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY`, `SUMMARY` the name,
  `X-TETRA-BIRTH-YEAR` when the year is known (the age shows, as the Calendar's Birthday action), `X-TETRA-CONTACT:<UID>`,
  the reminders Γενέθλια's events use now (9:00 on the day and 9:00 the day before; two also a week before) unless
  the setting says otherwise. Changing or removing the birthday in Contacts rewrites the event or moves it to
  Trash; the contact moved to Trash → its events too. In the Calendar, such an event shows "From Contacts" and Edit opens
  the contact's birthday (one place to change it).
- **The 11 events already in Γενέθλια** (from Google Calendar): on the first import each is matched to a contact by name;
  a review list shows the pairs ("Link" adds `X-TETRA-CONTACT` to the existing file — no second event), the unmatched
  stay as they are. No duplicates either way.
- **The Calendar's own Birthday action** writes into a calendar called "Birthdays" and makes one if missing — next to
  Γενέθλια that would make a second birthdays calendar. It uses the same setting from now on (and offers "Save as a
  contact too").
- **Moving the birthdays out of Google Contacts now** (the user's immediate need): contacts.google.com › Export ›
  vCard (or Takeout's zip) → Tetra › Contacts › Import → every contact in, every birthday into Γενέθλια, matched with the
  11 already there. Until the applet exists, the same could be done once by hand with the tetra-calendar skill from the
  exported .vcf (question 5).
- Later, if wanted: Greek name days (ονομαστικές εορτές) for each contact from a list of the fixed ones and the Easter-
  dependent ones (question 6).

### The photo from Photos' faces
- Photos already groups faces into people, each with a **uuid that crosses devices** (face_groups.uuid, SYNC_PLAN 6y)
  and a cover face (cover_uuid with its box in face_samples). Phone and desktop agree on both.
- **Link**: a contact's photo › "From Photos": the people Photos knows, those whose name matches the contact's first;
  tap one → its faces (the cover first) → tap the best → the face cropped square with room round it (the box × 1.8),
  512 px, into the contact's PHOTO, and `X-TETRA-PERSON` set. Also from the other side: a person's page in Photos ›
  "Contact" (link to one, or make one with that name).
- **Many at once**: after an import, "Photos knows 37 of these people — use their faces?" — a list, each with its face,
  untick any, OK.
- What it gives back: the contact page shows "In Photos: 213 photos" with a strip of the latest; Photos' person shows
  the contact's call/message buttons.
- The photo is copied into the file on purpose: other apps, the desktop and an export see it without Photos.
  "Update from Photos" makes it again (e.g. after a new cover).
- Other sources: any picture (picked, cropped round), the photo an import brought (Samsung's inline ones; Google's
  googleusercontent links fetched once at import — the only network use, can be skipped), Remove → the initial.

### Contact ↔ Photos person: one link (the user, 24 Oct: "face and name sync"; built 24 Oct)
- **In the contact's file:** `X-TETRA-PERSON` = the person's uuid (the same on every device, Drive SYNC_PLAN 6m/6y) and
  `X-TETRA-FACE` = "<the photo's SHA-256>;left,top,right,bottom" (fractions of the upright photo), the face the portrait
  shows. Both travel with Contacts' part, so any device can act on them.
- **The computer keeps the two sides in step** (desktop `contactfaces.js`, at start, on every contact change, every 5
  minutes): a portrait picked on the phone from an ordinary photo → the face its own analysis found inside that square on
  its copy of the photo goes to the contact's person (made with the contact's name; or the face's existing person —
  named, or "Person 12" with its other photos — becomes the contact's link) and is the person's portrait; names:
  "Person 12" takes the contact's, otherwise the side changed last wins; portraits: the contact's face is the person's
  cover, a cover chosen in Photos afterwards becomes the contact's photo. Photos' side reaches the phone by the faces' own
  sync (6y), the contact's by Contacts' part. Nothing happens until the photo is on the computer and analysed.
- **If the phone stopped detecting faces** (the user is considering it; nothing removed): Contacts would not change on the
  phone except that its From Photos and "Photos knows N of these people" would list the people the computer sends (they
  already land in the phone's face catalog through 6y); "Choose a picture" already records only the photo's SHA-256 and
  the middle square, needing no detector; the computer does every match. What would go: a portrait from a photo the
  computer does not have (not backed up) would stay a picture in the contact, not a face in Photos.

### Screens (the classic Tetra island; the iPhone's page made Tetra's)
**Phone — the list**
```
 ( Search contacts ………………… )         ← top pill, floats over the list as in Files
 ★ Favourites:  (●)(●)(●)(●)(●) →       ← round faces, one tap opens, long tap calls

 [ All · Favourites · Labels ]   (+)    ← bottom island, + New contact at the right;
                                           pulled up: the drawer (Import, Export, Merge & fix (3), Trash, Settings)
```
**Phone — a contact** (the user's screenshot, in Tetra's dark look and the contact's own colour)

History = calls with this person (from the phone's call log), and Tetra's own: events with them (the birthday, events
naming them), notes naming them.
Message → a strip: SMS · Viber · WhatsApp · Signal… (those the number has, below), per number; Call → Phone · Viber ·
WhatsApp; Video → WhatsApp/Viber/Meet video; Mail → the address(es). The first choice can be remembered per contact.

**Edit** (Edit at the top right, as the iPhone): one page, the fields grouped (name, phones, emails, dates, address,
more…), "Add field" for the rest (Google's Show more), ✓/× at the top. Many fields → a full page, not a popup (the
Office rule).

**Tablet / wide**: the list at the left (≈ 360 dp, its search pill on top), the open contact on the right as the phone's
page, wider (the buttons and cards in two columns under the photo); the island at the bottom left (All · Favourites ·
Labels), + at the right; Merge & fix and Import in the drawer. Portrait tablet: the phone's layout. Desktop: the same as
the tablet at the same widths (Notes' island and drawer), files read on every look and fs.watch'd as the Calendar.

**Merge & fix**: pairs side by side, the fields that differ marked; Merge (all values kept, one file, the other to
Trash) · Not the same (remembered in both files) · Merge all.

### Home
- **Tablet**: the groups stay two by two; Maps is no longer the whole width but one group like the others (its art and
  four places, 2×2 — the twelve stay in the app), paired with **Contacts**: its art and four favourites as round faces
  (an empty one "Add"), or New · Search · Favourites · Import (question 7).
- **Phone**: Contacts a group of its own under Maps; Maps unchanged (its eight half-size places).
- **Colour**: **the icon's own brown, ≈ #BB7848** (its edges run #B06E40–#C78656; tools/applet-icons.py takes the
  launcher's from the art as for every applet) — no applet is brown yet; tiles `lookTint(#D7A982 light, #8D5A3B dark)`.
- **Maps' colour**: the new Maps icon is sky blue (#24C3FE), the Maps group indigo (#5C6BC0). The groups follow their
  art's colour, so Maps → sky blue (distinct from Files' navy), question 8.

### Icons (found: ~/Tetra/Files/contacts.png and ~/Tetra/Files/maps.png, 1254 px, 23 Oct 20:39–20:40)
- Both are tiles with white corners, like the user's 17 Oct tiles: `tools/applet-icons.py` already cuts the corners
  (flood fill), makes Home's art (`drawable-nodpi/<name>_art.png`), the launcher foreground and `applet_colors.xml`.
  Wiring = add ("maps", "maps_art") and ("contacts", "contacts_art") to its two lists and run it; delete the hand-made
  vector `maps_art.xml`, `maps_launcher_fg.xml` and `applet_maps.xml`; `Applet.Contacts` + the `AppContacts` alias in the
  manifest (Settings › App icons). The two PNGs are copied into the repo's icon source folder first (not read from
  ~/Tetra at build time).
- Desktop: its nav uses symbol icons (Icon.tsx), not the art; Contacts gets a person symbol in its brown.

### Outside Tetra: what Android and the desktop allow (public APIs only, nothing paid)
**Possible on Android**
- Call: `ACTION_DIAL tel:` (no permission, opens the dialer) or `ACTION_CALL` (CALL_PHONE: rings at once). SMS:
  `smsto:`. Mail: `mailto:`. Address: geo: → Tetra Maps.
- **Other apps for a number — the system's own way**: Viber, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Meet put rows in the phone's
  contacts for the numbers that have them (their own MIME types, e.g. Viber's "Free message"/"Free call", WhatsApp's
  "Message"/"Voice call"/"Video call"). With READ_CONTACTS Tetra reads those rows for a contact's numbers and opens one
  with `ACTION_VIEW` on the row — exactly what the phone's own Contacts app does, so Message/Call/Video show only the
  apps that work for that number. Fallback links: `https://wa.me/<number>`, `viber://chat?number=<number>` (Viber does
  not document it; to try on the phone), `https://signal.me/#p/+<number>`, `tg://resolve?phone=<number>`.
- **Tetra's contacts seen by every app**: Tetra adds its own account ("Tetra", AccountManager) and writes its contacts
  into the system provider (ContactsContract RawContacts, read-only to other apps) from the files, one way. Then the
  dialer's caller ID, Viber/WhatsApp names, Android Auto's calling in the car and the keyboard all know them. Android
  joins them with the same person from the Google account. Edits are made in Tetra (the files are the truth).
- **The phone's contacts into Tetra**: the Google account's contacts already on the phone are read once (READ_CONTACTS,
  photos full size) — Google's contacts in without any export.
- Call history: READ_CALL_LOG, the calls to and from a contact's numbers. A restricted permission (Google Play allows it
  only for dialers); Tetra is installed by adb (tools/phone-install.sh), which allows it — to check on the phone.
- Share a contact: as a .vcf (Viber, WhatsApp, mail take it) or as a QR code (the Codes applet; scanning a vCard QR
  there offers "Add to Contacts").
- **Revolut**: there is no public way to send money to a phone number from another app. What works: a contact's
  Revolut username (a field "Revolut") opens `https://revolut.me/<username>` in Revolut to pay them. IRIS (Greek bank
  payments) has no public link either.

**Not possible (said plainly)**
- **Voicemail**: only the default phone app or the carrier's voicemail app may read it — so the iPhone's "Voicemail"
  tab becomes "History".
- Making Tetra the phone's dialer (the in-call screen, recording): possible only by becoming the default phone app —
  a whole dialer; not proposed.
- Reading Viber/WhatsApp chats, Viber Out credit, Revolut balances or payments: private, no public API.
- Google Contacts' own sync or API: needs a Google account sign-in and Google's servers — not Tetra's way.

**The desktop**
- The same files, a Contacts view as the tablet's. Mail opens `mailto:`; Viber desktop `viber://chat?number=`; WhatsApp
  `https://wa.me/…`. **A PC cannot place a phone call itself**; "Call on the phone" could ask the paired phone to dial
  (the computer already asks the phone things, SYNC_PLAN 6am) — later, question 9.

### Calls through the PC (the user, 23 Oct: "a notification from Tetra and I answer on the PC when the phone rings, or
I press Call on the PC and it starts on the phone?") — no dialer app needed for either
- **The phone rings → the PC shows it**: Tetra on the phone sees the call ringing (READ_PHONE_STATE, the number with
  READ_CALL_LOG) and tells the paired computer over Wi-Fi; desktop Tetra shows "Μαρία Π. is calling" with her photo,
  Answer · Reject. Answer → the phone answers (TelecomManager.acceptRingingCall, ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS — a runtime
  permission any app may ask); Reject / Hang up → endCall (same permission; Android marks it old — to try on the Xiaomi).
- **Call on the PC → the phone dials**: `POST /call` on the phone's SyncServer, as `/location` (6am): the same token
  and certificate; `SyncListenService` already listens with Tetra closed; the phone places it (TelecomManager.placeCall,
  CALL_PHONE). To check on the Xiaomi: HyperOS may hold calls started in the background (its "pop-up windows while in
  the background" permission). No phone answering → "Open Tetra on the phone", as the location says.
- **Where you talk**: only the PC's Bluetooth can carry the call's sound — paired as a hands-free kit (the PC here:
  Bluetooth controller, PipeWire 1.6.2, which has the hands-free role; not tried). Over Wi-Fi it is not possible: Android
  lets no app take a call's sound. So: Tetra carries the ringing and the buttons over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth the voice;
  without Bluetooth an answered call is spoken on the phone.
- **Bluetooth in the pairing** (the user, 23 Oct: "after the QR code in the setup ask for a Bluetooth connection too,
  and a Skip for whoever does not want it"): the computer's QR also carries its Bluetooth address; after the scan the
  phone asks "Connect Bluetooth for calls on the computer?" — Connect (BLUETOOTH_CONNECT; the phone bonds to that
  address, desktop Tetra makes the PC pairable for that minute and shows the same six digits as the phone) · Skip.
  Settings › Sync › the computer's card offers it again later. Phones only (a tablet has no calls).
- **Without Bluetooth** (the user: "on the contacts page, tapping the phone greyed out without Bluetooth, with a caption
  Connect bluetooth now to get calls"): on the computer's contact page, the Call buttons are grey while the phone is not
  connected by Bluetooth, and a tap shows "Connect Bluetooth now to get calls" with Connect (the same pairing). On the
  phone itself Call always works (it is the phone's own call).
- To check: PipeWire's hands-free role (WirePlumber's `bluez5.roles` with `hfp_hf`) on in the PC's setup.
- A step of its own after the Contacts (step 9), started with a hand test: the phone paired to the PC as a headset,
  one call.

### Code (smallest that holds)
- Android: `Contacts.kt` (vCard read/write, keep-the-rest, merge, import of 2.1/3.0/4.0/CSV/zip), `ContactsScreen.kt`
  (list, page, edit, merge), `ContactsSystem.kt` (the account and the provider copy, the other apps' rows), the birthday
  writer next to the Calendar's (CalendarFiles), the photo crop from Photos' face box. Reuse: the island and drawer,
  the Office strip for choosers, Calendar's file conventions, Codes for QR, Maps' geo: opening.
- Desktop: `contacts.js` (the same reading and writing; tests on the same fixtures as Android's) and `Contacts.tsx`.
- Tests: the user's three exports' field forms as fixtures (made-up names), round trip byte for byte on unknown lines,
  birthday ↔ event both ways, merge.

### Steps (each a commit, each checked on the tablet, then the phone and the PC)
- [x] (6e1314b) 1. Files + import (the phone's contacts, vCard, Takeout, CSV) + the list and the page (read only).
      Google's photo links (googleusercontent) are kept as links, not fetched (no network use yet).
- [x] (4d5bf65) 2. Edit, new, delete, labels, favourites. (The scope sync — later: the user, 23 Oct, "keep the sync for later so we
   dont have conflicts" with the send-to-computer work; until then the files travel with the whole Files sync as now.)
- [x] (f4fc436) 3. Birthdays and dates → the chosen calendar; Γενέθλια's 11 matched; the Calendar's Birthday action on the setting.
- [x] (e73e2e1) 4. Photos' faces → photos (one and many). Not yet: "In Photos: 213 photos" on the page, Photos' person › Contact.
- [x] (5b59438) 5. Call / Message / Video / Mail with the other apps' rows; call history. ACTION_DIAL (no CALL_PHONE);
   no fallback links (wa.me, viber://) when an app has no row; History = calls + the contact's dates (not notes naming them).
- [x] (290ca1a, 2af5ca8) 6. Tetra's contacts in the system provider (caller ID, Android Auto) — the user: yes (23 Oct). Account
   "Tetra", one-way copy from the files, read-only elsewhere; Contacts › drawer › In the phone's contacts (asks WRITE_CONTACTS).
- [x] (5a738e2, a922cf3) 7. Merge & fix; export; share as .vcf / QR (Codes: a scanned vCard › Add to Contacts).
- [x] (6e1314b, 290ca1a) 8. Home and the icons (the user, 23 Oct: "Contacts light brown, the icon yes, 4 slots"): Contacts'
   group (its icon, four favourites' faces); on the tablet Maps one group with four places beside it, on the phone as it
   was with Contacts under it; Maps' new icon (maps.png) and Home's Maps group in its sky blue (#25C4FE; the map's own
   markers stay indigo). Desktop Contacts: Drive branch `contacts` (ea6f7a3), the tablet's layout, the same files.
- [x] (52f7d96) Choose many (the user, 23 Oct: "how do I multi select?"): long press, then Label · Favourites · Share ·
   Export · Merge (two) · Delete.
9. Calls through the PC: the ringing on the PC with Answer/Reject, Call on the PC dialling on the phone, the voice by Bluetooth.

### Questions for the user
1. Plan OK as a whole? Start with steps 1–3 (in: the Google contacts and their birthdays) first?
2. Tetra's contacts in the phone's system contacts (caller ID, Viber names, the car) — yes? And later stop Google's
   contacts sync on the phone, or keep both?
3. The Contacts folder: hidden in Files like the Calendar's, or visible?
4. Birthday reminders: the same as Γενέθλια's now (9:00 on the day and 9:00 the day before), or other?
5. Birthdays out of Google now, before the applet: export the vCard and Claude puts them into Γενέθλια by hand?
6. Name days (ονομαστικές εορτές): wanted, later?
7. Home's Contacts tiles: four favourite faces, or New · Search · Favourites · Import?
8. Maps on Home: four places on the tablet's card? And its colour sky blue to match the new icon?
9. Desktop: a Contacts view; calls through the PC (§ Calls through the PC) as step 9 — wanted?

## Phone — the dialer applet (planned 24 Oct by the phone-plan session; nothing built until the user agrees)

**The user, 24 Oct (in Greek, relayed):** "make a plan for the dialer; take a look at what Google has; add vibration on
pickup of the call. Can we add call recording?" The icon: `Assets/phone.png` (a dark teal tile, a white handset with mint
ends). Tetra is going to Google Play (internal test first), so everything here keeps to Play's rules. Google's Phone app is
a feature list only (free software forever).

### The one big decision: Tetra becomes the phone's Phone app
A real dialer (its own in-call screen, Recents, blocking, vibration on pickup) is possible **only** as the phone's default
Phone app: `RoleManager.ROLE_DIALER`, asked with Android's own "Set Tetra as your default phone app?" dialog. Then Telecom
binds Tetra's `InCallService` for every call, ringing and outgoing, and Xiaomi's/Google's in-call screen is not shown.
- What it gives: everything below; the call log and phone permissions allowed by Play (the default handler is their
  main permitted use); hold, mute, keypad and merge from the computer's call bubble (today "Hold: not possible").
- What it costs: **every call depends on Tetra**. A crash in the ringing screen = a call not seen. Android itself
  keeps emergency calls working through the system dialer, and the role can be given back at any time (Settings › Apps ›
  Default apps › Phone app, or Tetra's own "Stop being the phone app"), but the bar is higher than any other applet.
- **The phone's own recording goes away while Tetra is the Phone app** (below): the record button lives in the
  system dialer's in-call screen, which is no longer shown.
- Without the role the applet still opens: Recents and the keypad hand the number to the system dialer (ACTION_DIAL),
  and a card offers "Make Tetra your phone app".

### What Google's Phone app has (checked 24 Oct) → what Tetra's has
| Google Phone | Tetra |
|---|---|
| Keypad with search as you type (T9) over contacts | the same, Latin **and Greek** letters on the keys (2 ΑΒΓ, 3 ΔΕΖ, 4 ΗΘΙ, 5 ΚΛΜ, 6 ΝΞΟ, 7 ΠΡΣ, 8 ΤΥΦ, 9 ΧΨΩ, accents ignored), over Tetra's own vCards; paste a number; `*#06#` and other codes passed to the system |
| Favourites (starred), speed dial | Favourites = Contacts' ★ (the same CATEGORIES); speed dial: hold 2–9 → a contact's number (Settings › Phone), hold 1 → voicemail |
| Recents: all / missed / contacts / non-spam, grouped by person and day, "call back", "add to contacts", delete | the same from `CallLog`: grouped (three in a row from Μαρία → one line "Μαρία (3)"), filters All · Missed · Unknown, delete one or many, a number not in Contacts → "New contact" / "Add to a contact" |
| Call details: each call's time, length, direction | the same; the contact page's History (already built) and the Phone's are the same list |
| Visual voicemail (carrier) | **no** in practice: Greek carriers do not offer visual voicemail; hold 1 calls the voicemail number (`TelephonyManager.voiceMailNumber`) |
| Call Screen (Google Assistant answers), Hold for Me, Direct My Call, Call Notes (AI transcript), Scam detection | **no**: Google's servers and Pixel-only models. Tetra's offline screening instead (below) |
| Caller ID & spam (Google's online database) | Tetra's contacts only (no online lookup); an unknown number shows its country/area ("Mobile · Greece", "Θεσσαλονίκη" from the 2310 prefix — a small table, offline) |
| Block numbers, block unknown/hidden callers | the same: `BlockedNumberContract` (the system's list, used by every app) + Settings › Phone › "Silence calls from numbers not in Contacts" / "Block hidden numbers" (`CallScreeningService`) |
| In-call: mute, speaker, keypad, hold, add call, merge, swap, Bluetooth/route picker, video, RTT | mute, speaker, keypad (DTMF), hold, add call, merge, swap, the route picker (Phone · Speaker · each Bluetooth device · **"Computer"** when the PC is the hands-free kit); video and RTT: no (Greek carriers barely offer them; WhatsApp/Viber video stay on the contact page) |
| Ringtone, per-contact ringtone, vibrate while ringing, "flip to silence" | the ringtone is Telecom's (system sound settings); a per-contact ringtone written into the provider copy Contacts already makes (CUSTOM_RINGTONE), so Android plays it; flip to silence (accelerometer, while ringing) — later |
| Dual SIM: ask each time / a default / per contact | the same: `TelecomManager.callCapablePhoneAccounts`; "Call with SIM 1 / SIM 2" when there are two, remembered per contact |
| Call recording (Pixel 6+, with a spoken notice; worldwide since Feb 2026) | **no** (below) |
| Quick replies on decline ("Can't talk now…") | the same: Decline ▸ a message (SMS opened with the text, as the system does — Tetra sends no SMS itself) |
| Proximity: screen off at the ear | the same (`PROXIMITY_SCREEN_OFF_WAKE_LOCK`) — must have |
| Android Auto calling | unchanged: the car uses its own in-call screen whoever the Phone app is |
| **Vibrate when answered** (not in Google's; some older dialers had it) | **yes** — the user's ask (below) |
| — | Tetra's own: a typed note on a call (kept in the call's history line, shown on the contact's History); the call on the computer and the tablet (below) |

### Vibration when the other side picks up (the user's ask)
- In Tetra's `InCallService`, each outgoing call's `Call.Callback.onStateChanged`: DIALING/CONNECTING → **ACTIVE**
  (`details.callDirection == DIRECTION_OUTGOING`, and only the first time — not after Hold → Resume) → one short buzz:
  `VibrationEffect.createWaveform([0, 60, 80, 60])` (two quick taps) through `VibratorManager`, `USAGE_COMMUNICATION_REQUEST`
  so Do Not Disturb's rules apply as for calls. VIBRATE is a normal permission.
- Why only as the Phone app: without the role Android tells an app only OFFHOOK at dialling, never "answered" (that is
  READ_PRECISE_PHONE_STATE, system apps only).
- On VoLTE and GSM the network says "answered" exactly when they pick up; a voicemail answering also counts as picked up
  (nothing can tell them apart).
- Settings › Phone › "Vibrate when answered" (on), and also "Vibrate when the call ends" (off) — the same one line.
- Also from the computer: a call placed from the PC buzzes the phone in the pocket and the bubble says "Answered".

### Call recording — said plainly
- **Tetra on the phone cannot record calls, not even as the default Phone app.** Since Android 10, during a call an
  ordinary app gets silence from the microphone and nothing from the call (`VOICE_CALL`, `VOICE_UPLINK/DOWNLINK`): only
  pre-installed apps with CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT (Xiaomi's and Google's own dialers) or an accessibility service may. Being
  the default dialer does not add it. So "the microphone on speaker" does not work either on Android 10+.
- The **accessibility-service workaround** (what Cube ACR and others do) is forbidden by Google Play (accessibility only
  for disability needs) and would also get Tetra rejected. Not doing it.
- **What the phone itself does**: the Xiaomi's own dialer, or Google Phone where it ships, records natively. That stays
  available as long as Tetra is *not* the Phone app — a real trade-off for question 2.
- **What Tetra can do: record on the computer.** When the call's sound is on the PC (Bluetooth hands-free, already built),
  the PC has both sides in good quality: the phone's HFP source (them) and the PC's microphone after the echo canceller
  (the user). Desktop Tetra can mix the two into an Opus/OGG file, e.g. `Tetra/Phone/Recordings/2026-10-24 15.36
  Μαρία Παπαδοπούλου.ogg`, and it syncs back to the phone and shows in the call's history line. A button "Record" on the
  call bubble.
- **The law (Greece, EU)**: Greek Penal Code art. 370A §1 (as changed by law 5002/2022) punishes recording **one's own**
  call without the other person's **explicit** consent (a felony); GDPR is light for purely personal use but not absent.
  So Tetra never records silently: "Record" first shows "Ask them first: recording without their explicit yes is a crime
  in Greece" with "They agreed — record" (Google's own recording plays a spoken notice to the other side; a PC recording
  can play one too into the call: "This call is being recorded"). Not legal advice; the user decides.

### What Android allows a non-system app (public APIs only)
| API | What | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `RoleManager.ROLE_DIALER` | become the Phone app | an activity for ACTION_DIAL (with and without `tel:`), an `InCallService` with BIND_INCALL_SERVICE and meta-data IN_CALL_SERVICE_UI (not IN_CALL_SERVICE_RINGING: then Telecom keeps playing the ringtone and the ring vibration) |
| `InCallService` / `Call` | the in-call screen; answer, reject (with a message), hold, unhold, mute, DTMF, conference/merge/swap, route (API 34 `CallEndpoint`), the call's state for the vibration | the role |
| `TelecomManager` | placeCall, the SIMs (PhoneAccounts), `isInCall`, voicemail number | CALL_PHONE, READ_PHONE_STATE (the role grants them) |
| `CallLog.Calls` | Recents, delete entries | READ_CALL_LOG, WRITE_CALL_LOG |
| `BlockedNumberContract` | the system's blocked list | only the default dialer/SMS app (no permission otherwise) |
| `CallScreeningService` | silence/block unknown or hidden numbers before they ring | the role (or ROLE_CALL_SCREENING) |
| full-screen ringing over the lock screen | the incoming call's screen | USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT (Play allows it for calling apps; a declaration) |
| `ContactsContract` CUSTOM_RINGTONE | a contact's ringtone | WRITE_CONTACTS (already asked) |
| capture of call audio | **not possible** | CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT is for system apps only |

### Google Play's rules (checked 24 Oct on Play's "SMS and Call Log permissions" policy)
- READ_CALL_LOG, WRITE_CALL_LOG, PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS: an app may ask for them **only while it is the default
  Phone (or SMS, or Assistant) app**, must ask for the role *before* asking for them, and must stop using them when it
  is no longer the default. A Permissions Declaration Form in Play Console says which use it is.
- **Today's Tetra already asks for READ_CALL_LOG without being the dialer** (Contacts' History, the ringing number for
  the PC's call bubble). Play has an exception that fits: "Cross-device sync or transfer (e.g. phone to laptop)" —
  READ_CALL_LOG only. So the Play build either (a) declares that exception, or (b) asks for the call log only after
  Tetra is the Phone app. With the Phone applet, (b) is the clean one: one declaration, "default Phone handler".
- CALL_PHONE, READ_PHONE_STATE, ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS are ordinary dangerous permissions (no form).
- Not about calls, but the same submission: MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE ("All files access") is in the manifest; Play allows it
  for file managers and backup/sync apps with its own declaration — Tetra's Files and sync are that, to be declared too.
- Accessibility for recording: forbidden (above).

### How it fits Tetra
- **Contacts** (built): names and photos come from Tetra's own vCards (`Tetra/Contacts`), read directly, so the in-call
  screen shows the contact's face from Photos. The contact page's Call button places the call through Tetra's Phone
  when it is the Phone app; its History reads the same call log (already built).
- **Calls on the computer** (built: the bubble, Answer/Decline/End, sound over Bluetooth, the echo canceller): with the
  role, the phone's reports come from the `InCallService` instead of guessing from `ACTION_PHONE_STATE_CHANGED` (no more
  "an outgoing call is reported only when the computer asked"), and the bubble gains Hold, Mute, Keypad and "Answered"
  (the vibration's moment). The `Watcher` stays for when Tetra is not the Phone app.
- **The call history on the computer**: the phone writes its calls as plain files, Calendar's way, so any AI can read
  them: `Tetra/Phone/calls-2026-10.jsonl`, one line per call
  `{"at":"2026-10-24T15:36:02+03:00","number":"+3069…","dir":"in|out|missed|declined|blocked","secs":124,"sim":1,"contact":"<UID>","note":"…"}`;
  a scope `phone` (DriveScope + desktop `files.js SCOPES`, as `contacts`), hidden in Files like Calendar's. The desktop's
  Phone view: Recents with the same filters, Call → the phone dials (`/call`, built). Written by the phone only (the PC
  never edits the log), deletions included. The phone's `CallLog` stays Android's; the files are a copy.
- **The tablet** (no SIM): the same Phone view as the desktop's — Recents from the synced files, the keypad and Call →
  the phone dials (the tablet asks the phone as the PC does), the call bubble with Answer/Decline/End. **The voice cannot
  go to the tablet**: Android tablets have no Bluetooth hands-free role for an app to use (Xiaomi's cross-device calling
  is HyperOS's own system code). So on the tablet you see, answer and end; you speak on the phone or its headset —
  or keep using HyperOS's calls for that.
- **Home**: Phone a group of its own (its art and four favourites to call with one tap, as Contacts' four faces; or
  Keypad · Recents · Missed (2) · Favourites), next to Contacts; on the tablet it shows only when a phone is paired.
  The icon by `tools/applet-icons.py` (Assets/phone.png → Assets/Icons/Applets/Phone.png → `phone_art` and
  `applet_phone_fg`, the launcher background the tile's own edge teal ≈ #0D6B73). **Its teal is close to Timer's**
  (#04D5CC launcher, #00796B on Home) — question 6.
- The applet is also what Android opens for every `tel:` link and the dialer shortcut.

### Screens (the classic Tetra island)
**Phone — Recents (opens here)**
```
 ( Search contacts and numbers ……… )      ← top pill
 Today
  (●) Μαρία Παπαδοπούλου (2)   ↙ 15:36  (📞)  ← ↙ in · ↗ out · red ↙ missed; tap = details, 📞 = call back
  (?) +30 2310 …  Θεσσαλονίκη  ↗ 12:02  (📞)
 Yesterday …
 [ Recents · Favourites · Keypad ]   (⋯)  ← bottom island; ⋯ = Missed / Unknown filter, Blocked, Settings
```
**Phone — Keypad**: the number at the top (large, grows smaller as it fills, ⌫), matching contacts under it as you type
(name with the matched letters bold), the 4×3 keys with Latin and Greek letters, the green round Call (SIM 1 / SIM 2 split
when two).

**In a call** (the user's dark look; the contact's own colour behind the face):
```
            ╭─────────╮
            │  photo  │                  ← 120 dp circle, or the initial
            ╰─────────╯
          Μαρία Παπαδοπούλου
          Mobile · +30 69…  ·  02:14     ← "Calling…" until ACTIVE (then the buzz)
   (🔇 Mute)  (⌨ Keypad)  (🔊 Speaker ▾)   ← Speaker ▾ = Phone · Speaker · Buds · Computer
   (⏸ Hold)   (＋ Add)    (📝 Note)        ← Merge / Swap appear with a second call
                  ( ⛔ End )               ← red, round, the thumb's place
```
**Ringing**: the face, name, "Mobile · Θεσσαλονίκη" for unknown numbers, swipe up = Answer, swipe down = Decline, a
small "Message" for a quick reply; over the lock screen. An ongoing-call notification with End and Mute (the system's
`Notification.CallStyle`).
**Tablet / wide**: Recents left (≈ 360 dp), the keypad or a call's details right; the call itself full screen.
**Desktop**: Recents + a keypad in the window; the call stays the bubble.

### Code (smallest that holds)
- Android: `PhoneScreen.kt` (Recents, Favourites, Keypad, settings), `PhoneCall.kt` (the `InCallService`, the in-call and
  ringing activity, vibration, proximity, CallStyle notification, reports to the PC), `PhoneScreening.kt` (the
  `CallScreeningService`), `PhoneLog.kt` (CallLog → `Tetra/Phone/*.jsonl`). Reuse: Contacts' reading, faces and
  `ContactsSystem` (the PC's call path, the calls' permissions), the island, the Office strip for choosers, `ScopedSync`.
- Desktop: `Phone.tsx` (Recents from the files, keypad → `/call`), the bubble's new buttons in `calls.js`; recording in
  `calls.js` (PipeWire's HFP source + mic → `pw-record` + ffmpeg, both on the PC) if wanted.
- Tests: the T9 matcher (Greek and Latin, accents), Recents' grouping, the jsonl writer; the in-call screen by hand with
  real calls on the Xiaomi (the emulator fakes calls with `adb emu gsm call`, which helps for the screens).

### Steps (each a commit; checked on the emulator as built — the user, 24 Oct: "use the emulator"; the real phone at the end)
- [x] (cf7305a, 657645c) 1. The role and the call screen: `PhoneInCall.kt` (PhoneInCallService, the calls' state, the buzz,
   proximity, Android's CallStyle notification with Answer · Decline / Hang up), `PhoneScreens.kt` (PhoneCallActivity over the
   lock screen: the contact's face, state and time, Mute, Speaker, Keypad with tones, End; the SIM choice when Telecom asks;
   the volume keys quiet the ringing); Settings › Phone (the role, Vibrate when answered on, Vibrate when a call ends off).
   Telecom keeps playing the ringtone (no IN_CALL_SERVICE_RINGING). Emulator: an incoming call (heads-up with the contact's
   name, Answer, the screen), an outgoing one answered by `gsm accept` — **the buzz played** (vibrator log: 60 ms, 80 ms gap,
   60 ms, usage COMMUNICATION_REQUEST), ringing over a sleeping screen, the screen closing after the call.
- [x] (7655505) 2. The Phone applet (`PhoneApp.kt`, `PhoneLog.kt`): Tetra's look — the search pill over the list, the island in
   the middle (Recents · Favourites · Contacts · Recordings) and the keypad a round button beside it (the user's ask). Recents
   grouped (calls in a row from one number on one day), All · Missed · Unknown, details with every call to that number,
   delete one or many, Android's missed-call notice cleared on looking; unknown Greek numbers say Mobile / Athens /
   Thessaloniki… (a small table); Favourites one tap to call (hold opens the contact); Contacts with a number; the keypad
   with search as you type in Latin **and Greek** (5-2-7 finds Μαρία), hold 0 for +, 1 voicemail, 2–9 speed dial (set in the
   sheet); Contacts' Call places the call at once when Tetra is the phone app; Contacts opens a new contact with a number
   from the Phone. PhoneLogTest.
- [x] (bea0880) 3. Hold, Add call, Swap, Merge (the other call a card on the screen), the sound's ways when there is more
   than earpiece and speaker (Phone · Headset · Speaker · each Bluetooth device, "Computer · <name>" for Tetra's paired
   computer, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT asked for the names), a note on a call (Tetra/Phone/notes.jsonl, shown under the call in
   Recents; a merged call's note goes to each person). Emulator: call waiting → hold → Swap/Merge → a merged call naming both.
- [x] (7df4e14) 4. Block / Unblock (Android's list) from a call's details and the sheet; `PhoneScreening` (the phone app's
   CallScreeningService): Silence numbers not in Contacts, Decline hidden numbers (Settings › Phone, both off); Decline with a
   message (four usual ones or one written; Telecom sends the SMS); a person's ringtone (CUSTOM_RINGTONE on the phone's
   contact for that number). Emulator: a blocked number logged as blocked; an unknown number silenced.
- [x] (e2722f2; Drive 869d707) 5. The computer: while Tetra is the phone app the call screen tells the computer (calling until
   answered, active, held, ended, muted; the old phone-state guess only otherwise); the bubble's Mute, Hold/Resume and Keys
   (tones) done by the phone. Android's call log copied to `Tetra/Phone/calls-YYYY-MM.jsonl` (one line per call: at, number,
   dir, secs, contact, name, note — PhoneHistory, tested), scope `phone` (DriveScope, files.js SCOPES), Phone kept out of
   Files' lists on both. Desktop: a Phone page (Recents from those files, Favourites, Contacts, Recordings, a keypad whose
   Call has the phone place it), Contacts' layout with the island centred. Also fixed on the way: **a new computer's first
   start never opened the window** (Contacts read a setting before the settings table was made). Emulator: the files written
   with notes, blocked and missed calls; the desktop page rendered with a sample file (scripts/shot.js, separate profile).
- [x] (5d822ee; Drive 5fabdc6) 6. The tablet: no calls of its own (no telephony), so its Phone shows the phone's Recents from
   the synced files and Call has the phone place it through the computer (`/call/place`); the computer passes each call's
   state on to the tablets (`/call/state?s=`), shown as a notification with Answer · Decline or Mute · Hold · End (done by the
   phone through `/call/act`); a call a tablet placed does not also open the computer's bubble. The voice stays on the phone.
   **Not tried: needs the tablet, the computer and the phone together.**
- [x] (56e2332) 7. Home: the Phone group in the icon's teal beside Contacts — the art, four favourites to call with one tap, the
   spare slots Keypad · Recents · Contacts; the icon by tools/applet-icons.py (Assets/Icons/Applets/Phone.png → phone_art,
   applet_phone, edge #02505B); Settings › App icons: Tetra Phone. Emulator: seen.
- [x] (540411b) 8. Play: Settings › Contacts no longer asks READ_CALL_LOG; a contact's History asks Android to make Tetra the
   phone app instead (the role grants the call log). A phone where it was granted keeps it. Declarations below.
- [x] (Drive 15240b0) 9. Recording on the computer: when the call's sound is there (Bluetooth, the echo canceller on), the bubble's
   Record first says "Ask them first: recording a call without the other person's explicit yes is a crime in Greece" and
   records only on "They agreed — record"; ffmpeg mixes the call speaker's monitor (them) and the echo-cancelled mic (the
   user) into Opus in `Phone/Recordings/2026-10-24 15.36 <name>.ogg`, synced to the phone's Recordings tab; stops on Stop, at
   the end, on quit. Checked: the same ffmpeg line on two test sinks (a 2 s Opus file, stopped by q); the bubble rendered.
   No spoken notice to the other side (question 3).
- [x] 10. Spam and unwanted (the user, 24 Oct: "a list Unwanted and spam: when they call and are in the list it closes and does not
   ring at all"; "callinsider.gr is very good — can we use it to say if it is a scam?"): `Tetra/Phone/spam.txt`, plain text — one
   number a line, a note after #, a * at the end for a range (69800*) — the same file on the phone, the tablet and the computer
   (scope phone). The phone app's screening declines a match before it rings, with no notice (Recents keeps it, marked Spam).
   Spam / Not spam on a call's details (on the phone also into Android's blocked list, so its SMS stop too), Spam on a ringing
   unknown call (declines it and lists it), the list with Remove and Add in the Phone's sheet (Android's blocked numbers join
   it once), and on the computer's Phone page (Spam filter, a button on unknown numbers). **CallInsider**: its terms forbid
   bots and collecting its data (robots.txt also shuts /api/), and an automatic look-up would send every caller's number to
   it — so no automatic check; a "CallInsider" button opens the number's page in the browser, as a person would. Their own
   Android app can sit beside Tetra as the phone's caller-ID/spam app (Android lets one app hold that role while Tetra is the
   phone app) — the user's choice. PhoneSpamTest. Emulator: a call in 69800* declined unrung (logged blocked); Spam on a
   ringing call listed the number and declined it.
- [x] 11. Both directions gone through again before the install (the user, 24 Oct: "check the dialer is finished in both
   directions"; on branch `phone` again, from main 41b5008). Found and fixed: **missed calls** were Android's own notice, whose tap
   opened Google's app — now Tetra's ("Missed call from Μαρία", Call back, Message; PhoneMissedReceiver for
   ACTION_SHOW_MISSED_CALLS_NOTIFICATION, only Telecom may send it) and the call log's VIEW opens Recents › Missed; the
   computer could hear of a ringing call twice (the old phone-state watcher stood down only once the call screen was bound;
   now whenever Tetra holds the role); **Xiaomi**: HyperOS keeps "Show on Lock screen" and "pop-up windows while running in
   the background" from sideloaded apps, without which a ringing call has no screen — Settings › Phone › On this Xiaomi ›
   Open (its own permission editor); the keypad's codes (*#*#4636#*#* through sendDialerSpecialCode, *#06# the IMEI or About
   phone; *100# stays a call) and paste (hold the number). Emulator: a missed call → Tetra's notice → Recents › Missed;
   *#*#4636#*#* opened Android's testing menu. Unit 627, 0 failing, 9 skipped; desktop 135/135.
   Still only on the real devices: the lock screen and pop-ups on HyperOS, the PC's bubble with Tetra as the phone app
   (answer/decline/end/hold/mute), calls placed from the PC, the history reaching the PC, the tablet's path, Record.
- [x] 12. Calls on the computer in one place (the user, 25 Oct: "the permission for PC calls out of the Contacts app … in
   Settings"; "the on/off on the contacts was a different thing, add that one too"; "when you turn calls on the PC on, the
   phone asks for the permission"): Contacts' drawer no longer asks (a line points to Settings › Phone); Settings › Phone ›
   With the computer has the **Calls on the computer** switch (on by default, phone prefs pc_calls — off, the computer
   hears of no call and cannot place one; turning it on asks Android's Phone permission when it is missing) and the
   **Phone permission** row (its state, Allow / Settings). The messages that said "Settings › Contacts" say Settings › Phone.
   Emulator: the switch off → on brought Android's "Allow Tetra to make and manage phone calls?". Branch phone-pc-calls.
- Checks at 540411b: unit 623 tests, 0 failing, 9 skipped (HomeLayoutTest counts the Phone's rows now); desktop `tsc` clean,
   `npm test` 135/135.
- [ ] **On the real devices** (the user's OK to install with tools/phone-install.sh): Settings › Phone › Make it, a real call
   each way (the buzz, the screen at the ear, the speaker, Bluetooth to the PC), the PC's bubble (Hold, Mute, Keys, Record),
   the tablet's notification and Call, a block. Merging both branches waits for the user.

### Google Play: the declarations (Play Console › App content), written 24 Oct
- **SMS and Call Log permissions** (READ_CALL_LOG, WRITE_CALL_LOG): core functionality "Default Phone handler"; Tetra asks for
  the role first (RoleManager), uses the call log only while it holds it (Recents, the copy for the user's own computer).
  The video Play asks for: Settings › Phone › Make it → Android's dialog → Recents.
- **Full-screen intent** (USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT): "Calling" — the incoming call's screen over the lock screen.
- **All files access** (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE): file manager and sync of the user's own files between their devices.
- **Foreground services**: dataSync (sync, photo analysis), specialUse (the Timer's countdown; listening for the paired
  computer), location (the phone's place for the computer's Maps) — each with the text already in the manifest.
- **Accessibility**: none used (recording through it is forbidden; Tetra records only on the computer).
- Not needed: SMS permissions (quick replies are sent by Telecom), PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS.

### Questions for the user
1. Make Tetra the phone's Phone app (with the risk that a Tetra bug can cost a call; the system dialer one tap away)? —
   the user, 24 Oct: "ok make a phone branch" (built; switched on in Settings › Phone after the install).
2. That turns off the phone's own call recording while Tetra is the Phone app. Is it used? (Seen 24 Oct: the phone's
   Phone app today is Google Phone, com.google.android.dialer; whether it offers recording on this Xiaomi is to see in its ⋮ › Settings.)
3. Recording on the computer when the call's sound is there (Bluetooth): wanted? With the "They agreed" step and a spoken
   notice to the other side, or the step alone? — the user asked for a Recordings tab (24 Oct): built with the step alone; a
   spoken notice on request.
4. Vibration: two quick taps on pickup — and also one on hang-up? — built: pickup on, hang-up a setting (off).
5. Two SIMs in the Xiaomi? — seen on the phone 24 Oct: one active SIM (Nova); the SIM choice is built anyway (Telecom asks the Phone app when there are two).
6. Colour: the icon's dark teal is near Timer's teal. Phone in the icon's teal anyway, or a green (calls' usual colour)?
7. Home's Phone group: four favourites to call, or Keypad · Recents · Missed · Favourites? — built: the favourites, and
   Keypad · Recents · Contacts in the slots left.
8. The tablet: the Phone view with calls through the phone (voice on the phone) — or leave the tablet to HyperOS's calls? —
   built (step 6); HyperOS's own calls still work beside it.

## Data — data usage, the plan, Wi-Fi strength and signal drops (planned 25 Oct by the data-plan session; nothing built until the user agrees)

**The user, 24–25 Oct (in Greek, relayed):** an applet to replace an old open-source F-Droid data monitor (its graph stops at
2 GB and is not flexible). The plan (size, renewal day, monthly / weekly / custom), warnings at 50 %, 80 % and all used,
graphs that scale to any size, Wi-Fi vs mobile, per app; the counts synced to the PC and the tablet so the three are seen
together, and the hotspot's share and loss worked out from them; a Wi-Fi strength meter for the best spot for the phone or
the router; a map of the house by Wi-Fi with the three devices ("maybe a spy thing"). Then: "look at the internet, see what
other apps like that do, and do it" — their features only, never their code (free software forever). **Battery left out**
(the user, 25 Oct: "the battery protection is a different applet, another time or maybe never"). Tetra goes to Google Play,
so everything keeps to Play's rules. Nothing leaves the user's devices.

**The user's answers, 25 Oct (in Greek):**
- "A **Setup page** that takes you by the hand step by step, to open it and put your things in. Mine is unlimited, but not
  unlimited — there is a limit, I think **300 GB**." → the Setup below; the plan kind "Unlimited with a fair-use limit". (The
  limit is Nova's fair-use policy in the contract, not a law as far as known; Setup says "the number is in your carrier's terms".)
- Live speed in the notification: "ideally yes" → in (feature 1).
- The house map: one floor; "I've seen it done — from the many devices and the noise of the signal you can tell where furniture
  and obstacles are, very 'dirty', not like a photo, but something comes out." Then: "**I don't want us to build the map**, it
  just seemed interesting how it works. Make the strength meter, if we can find [the best spot] that way." → the map is not
  built; how it works is explained under "The house map — how it would work (not built)"; the meter gains **Spots** to find
  the best place without a map.
- The hotspot: "we count the data on the phone, then on the tablet and the PC; take the tablet's and PC's from the phone's and
  we have the losses — and also **which one uses the most**." → feature 2 as the user put it.
- "We can also **measure signal drops**." → feature 4.
- Roaming: "good, put it in — but I roam with a **day pass: €15 for 300 MB** (it was in North Macedonia [Skopje]). It could
  also **notify automatically to turn roaming off**." → Roaming in feature 1.

### What the other apps do (checked 25 Oct) → can Tetra do it
| App | Its key features | Tetra on Android, with what it can get |
|---|---|---|
| **Android's own Data usage** (Settings › Network) | the cycle and its day, a warning and a **hard limit** (mobile data cut off), per app with foreground/background, Data Saver, "unrestricted data" per app, Wi-Fi marked metered | everything shown **yes** (the same counts, `NetworkStatsManager`). Setting Android's warning or limit, cutting data, Data Saver: **no** — `NetworkPolicyManager` is system-only; Tetra's warnings are its own notifications, and "Turn on Data Saver / set a limit" opens Android's page (`Settings.ACTION_DATA_USAGE_SETTINGS`) |
| **Data Monitor** (drnoob, F-Droid, GPL; most likely the user's old app — question 1) | per-app stats, a plan with a **daily quota** and **rollover**, alerts, days left on the home screen, a widget, mobile/Wi-Fi/both | **yes**, all of it; the graph without its cap |
| **DataStopwatch** (F-Droid) | counts from "start" to "stop" over a chosen time | **yes**: a "stopwatch" counter (a trip, a film streamed) — cheap, in |
| **My Data Manager** | plan with cycle and start date, "unlimited" plans, mobile / Wi-Fi / **roaming** split, hourly history, a daily budget alarm, alarms at 90 %, **shared / family plans** across phones (its own servers) | plan, unlimited, roaming, hourly, daily budget, any thresholds: **yes**. Shared plans: **yes, but only between the user's own devices** through Tetra's sync (no server, no other people's phones) |
| **GlassWire** | per-app graphs by hour/day/week/month, plan alerts, **"a new app went online"** alert, a **firewall** (block an app on Wi-Fi or mobile) through a local VPN, throttling alert on "unlimited" plans | graphs and alerts: **yes**; "new app used data" alert: **yes** (a UID seen for the first time in the stats — off by default). Firewall: **not planned** — only through `VpnService`, which Play allows only for apps whose core is a VPN/firewall (with a declaration), it takes the phone's one VPN slot and routes every packet through Tetra (battery, risk). Throttling detection: no (needs internet speed tests to a server) |
| **NetGuard** (F-Droid, GPL) | firewall per app (Wi-Fi / mobile), usage per app per address, "an app accessed the internet" notices, speed graph in the status bar (Pro) | firewall and per-address logs: **no** (the VPN above). Live speed in the status bar: **yes** (`TrafficStats` once a second, screen on only) — the user wants it |
| **WiFi Analyzer** (VREM, F-Droid, GPL) | list of networks with strength, channel graphs, **channel rating** (least crowded), strength over time, estimated distance, 2.4/5/6 GHz and widths, vendor lookup (offline OUI list), export | **yes**, all: `WifiManager.getScanResults` with the location permission (Tetra has it, for Maps) and Location on; scans throttled by Android (below). Vendor lookup: an offline OUI table (~1 MB) — later |
| **NetSpot** (Android) | **site survey**: a floor-plan photo, calibrated, tap where you stand, heat maps (signal, signal-to-interference), predictive planning (paid), speed test (download, ping) | channel interference: **yes**. Survey and heat map: possible, **not built** (the user, 25 Oct; Spots instead, and how a map would work at the end). Speed test: **yes to the PC** (Tetra's own server on the LAN — the Wi-Fi's real speed, no internet server); an internet speed test needs someone's server — **no** |
| **WiFiman** (Ubiquiti) | live signal graph, speed test (their servers), a scan of the devices on the network, a heat map that follows you with the camera's **AR** tracking | live graph: **yes**. AR tracking: **not planned** — ARCore is Google's closed library (free software forever); Tetra uses taps and walked lines instead. Device scan of the LAN: possible (ARP/mDNS), not asked — later |

**Taken in** (worth having and possible): the plan with daily quota, rollover and unlimited; roaming; hourly history; a daily
budget; any thresholds; the stopwatch counter; "a new app used mobile data"; apps using data in the background (state
field); a channel rating; strength over time; saved spots to compare; a speed test to the PC; live speed; signal drops. **Not possible or not done**:
cutting data or setting Android's limit (system-only), a firewall (VPN, Play's VPN rule), throttling and internet speed tests
(someone's server), AR tracking (closed library), shared plans with other people (a server).

### What Android allows (exact; checked 25 Oct in the SDK's own sources, android-36.1, and Android's docs)
| API | What it gives | Needs / limits |
|---|---|---|
| `NetworkStatsManager.querySummary / queryDetails / queryDetailsForUid`, `querySummaryForDevice` | bytes and packets per **UID**, per network type (`TYPE_MOBILE`, `TYPE_WIFI`), with the bucket's **roaming**, **metered**, **foreground/background state**, default network. Special UIDs: `UID_TETHERING` (**the hotspot**), `UID_REMOVED`, system | **Usage access** (`PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`): an app-op the user turns on in Settings › Special app access › Usage access (`Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS`); no dialog. Without it: only Tetra's own UID, and `TrafficStats` device totals since boot (no history). With it the "device summary" level: all apps of the user plus tethering, removed apps and the system |
| history and freshness | AOSP keeps about **90 days** (per-app buckets of 2 h, device totals 1 h; OEMs may change it — step 1 reads the oldest bucket on the Xiaomi). A query polls first by default, but "for any non-privileged caller, the poll might be omitted in case of rate limiting" (the source's words): numbers can lag up to ~30 min | Tetra keeps its own copy (below), so the history outlives the 90 days |
| `NetworkStatsManager.registerUsageCallback(type, subscriberId, thresholdBytes, cb)` | a call when usage on mobile passes a threshold — the 50/80/100 % warnings on time | "as long as the process is live": a backstop look is needed (the listen service usually keeps Tetra alive; else the hourly job). Thresholds under **2 MiB** fire only at 2 MiB (`MIN_THRESHOLD_BYTES`) |
| **per SIM** | — | **not possible directly** since Android 10: the `subscriberId` is for privileged/carrier apps only; `null` means "all mobile networks". Tetra can split going forward only: it samples mobile bytes and which SIM carries data (`SubscriptionManager.getActiveDataSubscriptionId`, no permission) at each change of the data SIM and each hourly look. The user has one active SIM (Nova, seen 24 Oct) — so later |
| per Wi-Fi network (home, work, the phone's hotspot) | — | Android's per-network Wi-Fi template is system-only. Tetra logs **when** it was on which network (`ConnectivityManager` network callback) and asks the totals for those hours. The SSID needs the location permission (redacted otherwise); **the phone's hotspot is known without it** — the gateway is the phone's address Tetra already syncs with |
| per-app names | `PackageManager` | Android 11+ hides other apps unless declared: a `<queries>` with MAIN/LAUNCHER (every app with an icon) is enough — **not** `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` (Play restricts it to search, antivirus, file managers and browsers). The rest show as "Android system", "Removed apps", "Hotspot" |
| `WifiInfo` of the connected network (`NetworkCapabilities.transportInfo`) | RSSI (dBm), link speed up/down, frequency/band, Wi-Fi standard | **RSSI needs no permission** (only SSID/BSSID are redacted without location); the system refreshes it every few seconds while the screen is on — enough for the meter |
| `WifiManager.startScan / getScanResults` | every network around: SSID, BSSID, RSSI, channel, width, standard, **is80211mcResponder** | **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION even on Android 13+** (Android's docs: `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` does not cover these two), and Location switched on. **Throttled**: 4 scans per 2 minutes in the foreground, 1 per 30 minutes in the background (Android 9+); only the user can lift it (Developer options › Wi-Fi scan throttling) |
| `WifiRttManager.startRanging` (Wi-Fi RTT, 802.11mc) | the distance to an access point within ~1–2 m | `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (13+) or fine location; the phone must have `FEATURE_WIFI_RTT` and **the router must be an 802.11mc responder** — few home routers are (mesh systems such as Google/Nest Wifi are). One router = one distance, a circle, not a place; a place needs 3+ responders |
| `TelephonyCallback` (SignalStrengths, DataConnectionState, DisplayInfo, ServiceState) | the mobile signal's level, data on/off, 5G/4G/3G, no service — the drops | **no permission** (READ_PHONE_STATE already held for Phone); the operator's name and cell need location (not used); only while Tetra's process lives |
| Wi-Fi sensing of walls, furniture, people (CSI) | — | **not possible**: channel-state information comes only from special chips/firmware (research Wi-Fi cards, ESP32, rooted phones with patched firmware); no phone API and no ordinary Linux driver gives it; 802.11bf sensing is not exposed to apps either. Walls and furniture are what the user draws |
| roaming | `TelephonyManager.isNetworkRoaming`, `networkCountryIso`, `isDataRoamingEnabled`; buckets' roaming flag | no permission (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE for the last); **switching data roaming off: not possible** for an app (system setting) — Tetra opens `ACTION_DATA_ROAMING_SETTINGS` |

**Google Play's rules** (checked 25 Oct; the "Permissions and APIs that Access Sensitive Information" policy):
- **Usage access** is not on Play's restricted list (no declaration form), but it is personal data: a **prominent disclosure**
  in Tetra before sending the user to Settings ("Tetra reads how much data each app used, to show it to you; it stays on
  your devices") and the **Data safety** form says app activity is read and **not shared**; that Tetra's sync to the user's
  own computer counts as "collected" or not is the same question as for the rest of Tetra.
- **Location** (already declared for Maps): used for Wi-Fi scans only while the Wi-Fi tools are open — **foreground only**;
  never background location for this (Play rejects it "without compelling justification").
- **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES**: not asked (the `<queries>` above). **VpnService**: not used.

### What the applet does (the feature list)
**0. Setup (the first time Data opens; again from Settings › Data › Setup)** — one step a page, ‹ Back / Next, a dot row:
1. What Data does and that nothing leaves the user's devices (Play's prominent disclosure for Usage access).
2. **Usage access**: why, then "Open Android's page" (`Settings.ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS` with Tetra's package; on HyperOS
   the page found in step 1 of the build), Tetra's row lit up in a picture; back in Tetra the step ticks itself ✓ (checked on
   resume). Skip = Tetra's own use and today's totals only.
3. **Your plan**: Limited (size) · **Unlimited with a fair-use limit** (the limit, e.g. 300 GB — "the number is in your
   carrier's terms") · Unlimited (no limit; warnings off, the graphs stay). **Roaming**: in the EU as at home (the plan's
   EU fair use, optional) · outside the EU a **day pass** (price and size, e.g. €15 for 300 MB) or none (pay per MB).
4. **When it renews**: day N of the month (Feb gives the last day for 29–31) / weekly on a weekday / every N days from a date.
   Daily quota and rollover under "More".
5. **Used so far this cycle** (optional): the carrier app's number, so Tetra starts level with it.
6. **Warnings**: 50 · 80 · 100 % ticked (add or remove); a day's budget passed (off). Asks for notifications
   (POST_NOTIFICATIONS) if not allowed.
7. **Live speed** in the status bar: on/off.
8. **Wi-Fi around** (optional): the location permission and Location on, for the channel view; Skip is fine.
9. Done: the Data page with the first numbers (history already there — Android kept the last ~90 days).

**1. Usage and the plan (phone; the tablet for its own Wi-Fi)**
- The plan as Setup set it; for "Unlimited with a fair-use limit" the warnings count against the limit and the ring says
  "of 300 GB fair use".
- "Correct to the carrier's figure" any time (Setup's step 5 again); Tetra keeps the difference for this cycle (Tetra's count
  and the carrier's always differ a little: headers, rounding, what the carrier does not count).
- Warnings (notifications): 50 %, 80 %, 100 %, "a day's budget passed" (off), "a new app used mobile data" (off), roaming
  started (on). At 80 % and 100 % a button "Android's data settings" (to set Android's own limit or Data Saver).
- Numbers on top: used / plan, left, days left, **daily average**, **today's budget** ((left) / (days left)), the
  **projection** to the cycle's end (the last 7 days' pace) — "at this pace you run out on 3 Nov".
- Graphs (Tetra's own Canvas chart, no library): bars per hour / day / week / month, Mobile and Wi-Fi stacked; the cycle's
  running total as a line with the plan's line and the projection dashed. **The axis scales to the data** (1-2-5 steps,
  B → TB; a 40 GB month and a 3 MB hour both fill the chart); pinch and drag through time; tap a bar → that hour's / day's apps.
- Per app: list sorted by use, mobile / Wi-Fi / roaming, **foreground vs background**; an app's page with its own graph and
  "Android's settings for this app" (to restrict its background data). Hotspot, Android system, removed apps as rows.
- **Roaming** (the user's: outside the EU a day pass, €15 for 300 MB, as in North Macedonia):
  - Tetra sees roaming begin (`TelephonyManager.isNetworkRoaming`, the network's country `networkCountryIso`; no permission)
    and tells EU from outside it (a small list of EU/EEA country codes). On crossing into a non-EU country: "Roaming in North
    Macedonia — outside the EU. Your day pass: €15 for 300 MB a day. Data roaming is ON" with **Turn off data roaming**
    (opens Android's page, `Settings.ACTION_DATA_ROAMING_SETTINGS`) and Keep on. Android lets no app switch it itself
    (a system setting) — so Tetra opens the switch, one tap away.
  - While roaming: the day's roaming use against the pass ("212 of 300 MB today"), warnings at 80 % and 100 % of the day's
    300 MB, each with Turn off data roaming; **the moment a day starts costing**: "First roaming data today — today counts
    €15" (most day passes start at the first MB); the trip's total days and cost ("3 days · €45 · 640 MB").
  - Back home: "Roaming ended" and the trip kept as a line in the history. Data roaming left ON on return: a reminder to
    turn it off (`isDataRoamingEnabled`, readable).
  - In the EU: counted against the plan's EU fair use (if set), no day-pass warnings.
- The stopwatch: Start → Stop counts mobile and Wi-Fi for a trip or a film; kept in a short list.
- **Live speed** (the user: yes): ↓ and ↑ drawn as the status-bar icon ("1.2M"), the notification "↓ 1.2 MB/s ↑ 80 KB/s ·
  today 1.4 GB mobile"; `TrafficStats` totals read once a second **only while the screen is on** (a screen-off receiver stops
  it: no cost in the pocket). It needs a running service: when Tetra's listening service runs (it usually does), **its**
  notification carries the speed — one icon, not two; otherwise Data's own small foreground service (specialUse, "shows the
  network speed the user asked for"). Silent channel, lowest importance.

**2. Three devices together (sync) and the hotspot** (the user's way)
- Each device counts its own and writes it as files (below); every Tetra shows the three side by side.
- **The hotspot, as the user put it**: the phone counts what its hotspot carried (`UID_TETHERING`; Android gives no split per
  client); the tablet and the PC each count what they used **while connected to the phone's hotspot** (their gateway is the
  phone). **Phone's hotspot − (tablet + PC) = the difference** ("losses"), and **who used the most**:
  ```
   Hotspot this cycle (counted by the phone)   4.9 GB
     PC         3.0 GB  ██████████████  61 %   ← the most
     Tablet     1.6 GB  ███████          33 %
     Difference 0.3 GB  █                 6 %   ← what the phone carried that the two did not count
  ```
  per cycle, per day and per hour (tap a bar). The phone's own use (its apps) is shown beside it, apart.
- What the difference is, said under it: another device on the hotspot (a guest), hours when the PC or tablet was not
  counting (Tetra closed or off), and small overheads (headers, DNS answered by the phone). Tetra's own sync between the
  devices over the hotspot never touches the mobile network; the clients count it, so Tetra subtracts its own sync bytes on
  their side first. A difference **below zero** is possible too (the clients counted local traffic the phone never sent to
  the network). The carrier's bill follows the phone's mobile count.
- The numbers arrive when sync next can; nothing is live, nothing urgent.

**3. Wi-Fi strength meter — and finding the best spot without a map (phone and tablet)**
- The connected network: a big dBm number and bar (−30 excellent … −67 good for calls/video … −75 fair … −85 poor), link
  speed, band, standard; a line of the last 2 minutes; a **sound mode** (a beep that rises with the signal, like a metal
  detector) to walk the house with the screen in the pocket. No location needed.
- **Spots** (instead of the map): stand somewhere, "Save this spot" → a name ("desk", "bedroom", "balcony") and ~10 s of
  readings averaged (RSSI, link speed, and the speed to the PC if it is reachable). The Spots list, best first, with bars:
  "desk −52 dBm 433 Mb/s · bedroom −74 dBm 72 Mb/s". Saving again replaces a spot's reading (before/after moving the router).
  Two uses:
  - **Where to put the router**: try it in two or three places, walk the same spots each time → Tetra lays the rounds side by
    side ("router in the hall: every spot ≥ −65; on the TV shelf: bedroom −79") and says which round was best.
  - **Where to put the phone as the hotspot** (the user's usual case): the PC and the tablet stay where they are; as the phone
    is moved, each reports what it sees of the phone's hotspot (RSSI, link speed, every 2 s, through SyncServer — the phone, as
    the access point, reaches both). The phone's screen: "PC −58 dBm 433 Mb/s · Tablet −71 dBm 144 Mb/s"; "Save this place"
    keeps it, and the places are ranked by the worse of the two. The PC reads its own from Linux (`iw dev <if> link` /
    `/proc/net/wireless`, no root). Needs the PC and the tablet on with Tetra running for those minutes.
- **Around**: the networks near, their channels as WiFi Analyzer draws them, and a **channel rating** ("your router is on
  channel 6 with 9 neighbours; 1 has 2") — needs location + Location on; 4 scans per 2 minutes. Neighbours' names are shown,
  never kept.
- **Speed to the PC**: Tetra downloads/uploads 20 MB to the paired computer's server over the LAN → Mb/s and the ping — the
  Wi-Fi's real speed at that spot, no internet server.
- **RTT bonus**: if a scan says the router is an 802.11mc responder and the phone supports RTT, the meter also shows the
  distance to it (± 1–2 m). Most likely not with the user's router — step 1 checks.

**4. Signal drops (phone, tablet, PC)** (the user: "we can also measure signal drops")
- **Mobile** (phone): no service, mobile data lost and back, the generation falling (5G → 4G → 3G), and the bars, from
  Android's own callbacks (`TelephonyCallback`: SignalStrengths, DataConnectionState, DisplayInfo, ServiceState — no new
  permission; the operator's name and cell need location and are not used). A drop = data or service gone for ≥ 5 s, or the
  signal at the lowest level for ≥ 30 s.
- **Wi-Fi** (phone, tablet): the network lost and back (`ConnectivityManager` network callback), RSSI below −80 dBm for
  ≥ 30 s. On the **PC**: the Wi-Fi link down/up and its signal (NetworkManager, `iw`), and — on the phone's hotspot — the PC
  falling off it.
- A **Drops** list and a strip under the day's chart: "14:02 mobile data lost 40 s (4G) · 17:31 PC left the hotspot 2 min";
  per day a count; the three devices together (so "the PC drops off the hotspot every evening" shows).
- Recorded only while Tetra's process lives (the listening service usually keeps it so; the PC while the desktop runs); the
  hours it was not watching are shown as gaps, not as "no drops". A notification only as a daily summary, off by default.

### The files (Tetra/Data; synced as Calendar and Contacts, hidden in Files)
```
Tetra/Data/                              (~/Tetra/Files/Data on the PC)
  plan.json                       {"kind":"fair-use","size":"300GB","renew":{"every":"month","day":5},"daily":null,"rollover":false,
                                   "roaming":{"eu":"plan","pass":{"price":15,"currency":"EUR","size":"300MB","per":"day"}},"warn":[50,80,100],"carrier":{"cycle":"2026-10-05","offset":-120000000},"rev":3,"by":"24091RPADG"}
  usage/2026-10.24091RPADG.jsonl  the phone: one line per hour and network kind, per app per day, and each drop:
      {"h":"2026-10-25T14","net":"mobile","rx":51234567,"tx":3456789,"roam":0}
      {"d":"2026-10-25","app":"org.mozilla.firefox","name":"Firefox","net":"mobile","fg":120000000,"bg":3000000}
      {"d":"2026-10-25","app":"hotspot","net":"mobile","rx":…,"tx":…}
      {"drop":"mobile-data","at":"2026-10-25T14:02:11+03:00","secs":40,"gen":"4G"}
  usage/2026-10.theologos-82xm.jsonl   the PC: {"h":…,"net":"wifi","via":"phone-hotspot","rx":…,"tx":…,"tetra":…} and its drops
  spots/24091RPADG.jsonl          the saved spots: {"at":…,"spot":"desk","round":"router in the hall","rssi":-52,"band":5,"speed":433,"pc":{"mbps":310,"ms":4}}
```
- **Each device writes only its own files** (Timer's rule), so sync never has two versions of one; `plan.json` goes by the
  highest `rev` (`by` the device; on a tie the device with mobile data). A month's file is rewritten whole each hour (~100–300 KB),
  its first line `{"deviceName":…,"counted":<ms>}`. Should sync still leave copies ("… (2).jsonl"), each reader takes the newest
  version of a device's month and the cleanup removes the older ones (25 Oct, data-calls session).
- Plain JSON lines, so any AI can read them ("how much did I use in October?", "when did the PC drop off the hotspot?").
- Scope `data` (DriveScope + desktop files.js `SCOPES` and `APP_FOLDERS`), pushed with `ScopedSync.soon("data", …)` once an
  hour, not at every change.

### How it runs (the battery cost kept small)
- **Phone**: an hourly look (the existing SyncJob schedule or its own JobScheduler job, no network needed) reads
  NetworkStats for the last hours and rewrites this month's file; `registerUsageCallback` for the next warning while Tetra is
  alive (the listen service usually keeps it so). The network and telephony callbacks log changes and drops (they wake
  nothing; Android calls them). Live speed: once a second, screen on only.
- **Tablet**: the same look for its own Wi-Fi, its hours on the phone's hotspot and its Wi-Fi drops.
- **PC**: the running desktop reads `/sys/class/net/<if>/statistics/{rx,tx}_bytes` each minute, the gateway (phone's
  hotspot or not), the SSID and link from NetworkManager (`nmcli`), and writes its hourly lines and drops. Per program on
  Linux: **no** (needs root/eBPF). Nothing when the PC is off (its hours are gaps).
- The meter, Spots and Around: only while their screens are open.

### Screens

Send log.

### Fit with Tetra
- **Icon** (the user's, 25 Oct: `Assets/DataMeter.png`, 1254 px): a lime gauge with a needle over three rising bars on a
  near-black rounded tile → `tools/applet-icons.py` (art, launcher, `applet_colors.xml`), Settings › App icons: Tetra Data.
  **Unlike the other tiles its corners are dark, not white** (#232629 outside, #1F2226 just inside the tile, with a soft
  shadow): the script's flood fill from the corners (thresh 60) would eat the tile too — Data's corners are cut with a
  rounded-square mask instead (the tile ≈ 30…1224 px, corner radius ≈ 190 px; measured when built). Copy it into
  Assets/Icons/Applets/Data.png first, as the others.
- **Colour** (from the icon): **lime #A1F81A** (the arcs run #85F31D–#BFFB30) for Home's group and Category.Data; the
  launcher background the tile's own charcoal ≈ #1C1F22 (as Phone's is its tile's dark teal). No applet is lime yet; Photos'
  #95DF6B is a softer green beside it. On the light theme lime on white is too faint: text and lines a darker lime (≈ #4E8A0A)
  — `lookTint(light, dark)` as the others.
- Notifications: "Data warnings" (50/80/100 %, budget, roaming, new app); "Live speed" (silent, lowest; or inside the
  listening notification); "Drops" (a daily summary, off); "Data meter" (the sound mode, while on).
- Reuse: Contacts' island and pills, Settings' rows, `ScopedSync`, SyncServer for the
  hotspot reports and the speed test, Home's group card.

### Code (smallest that holds)
- Android: `Data.kt` (the plan and its kinds, the cycle maths, projection and budget, the files), `DataStats.kt`
  (NetworkStats → hours and apps, tethering, the hourly job, the usage callback, live speed), `DataScreen.kt` (Setup, the
  screens, the chart), `DataSignal.kt` (meter, Spots, phone-as-hotspot reports, Around, speed test, drops). Manifest:
  `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` (tools:ignore ProtectedPermissions), the `<queries>`.
- Desktop: `data.js` (counters, gateway, nmcli, `iw`, the hourly file, drops, the speed-test and signal endpoints),
  `src/Data.tsx`.
- Tests: the cycle maths (renew on the 31st in February, weekly, custom, rollover, fair-use), roaming days and their cost (a day counted at its first MB, EU or not), the projection and budget, the
  nice axis (B → TB), merging three devices' files and the hotspot box (who used most, a negative difference, Tetra's own sync
  taken off), drop detection (5 s / 30 s rules, flapping joined into one), Spots' rounds ranking; desktop: the counter
  reader and drop detection with a fake /sys and nmcli output.

### Steps (each a commit; checked on the emulator as built, the real phone and tablet at the end)
- [x] 1. Look on the real devices (read-only, adb). **The tablet (25 Oct 09:05, Data installed over 24 Oct's build, its data
   kept and backed up to Coding/backups/tablet-20261025-0905)**: Android keeps per-app counts from 19 Jul (98 days, 2-hour
   buckets) and device totals from 4 Jul (1-hour); the usage-access page opens straight on Tetra's own switch ("Να επιτρ. η
   πρόσβαση σε δεδομ. χρήσης εφαρμ.") — and Tetra already had the access on this HyperOS (it counted every app without it
   being switched there); its Wi-Fi on the phone's hotspot is `metered=true` in Android's own records, so Data showed "70 GB
   over the phone's hotspot" of October's 98 GB; the meter −32 dBm on "Xiaomi 15", channel 1, 400 Mb/s; no Wi-Fi RTT
   (Wi-Fi Aware yes); its name "Xiaomi Pad 7 Pro". **The phone (09:10, installed with tools/phone-install.sh; Android Auto
   approved Tetra Maps again; its data backed up to Coding/backups/phone-20261025-0910)**: Android keeps per-app counts and
   device totals from 15 Jul (102 days); 4G with 5G NSA (`overrideNetwork=NR_NSA`, Data says 5G); the hotspot on (wlan2,
   tethered) and its traffic kept under the tethering UID; no Wi-Fi RTT; its name "Xiaomi 15"; Usage access **not** on
   (unlike the tablet), so Data counts nothing until Setup's step 2. **The user's Setup (25 Oct 09:13)**: fair use 300 GB,
   renews on the 4th, warnings 50 and 90 %, Nova's figure typed: Tetra had counted 128.4 GB mobile since 4 Oct, Nova said
   ≈ 120.7 GB (Tetra 6 % higher: the carrier's figure lags, and the cycle's first hours are snapped to Android's 2-hour
   buckets) — Data shows 121 GB, 40 %, 10 days left, at this pace 182 GB. **The hotspot**: 119.1 GB of the 128.4 (93 %);
   the tablet counted 70 GB over it in October (59 %); the other 49 GB are the computer's and any guest's, which the
   computer reports once its new Tetra runs. Seen on the phone: "Year" wrapped in the span chips — fixed, goes with the next install.
- [x] 2. (205ad93, data-plan session, 25 Oct; Drive-Android branch claude/data-plan) Setup and usage: `Data.kt` (plan, cycles, status,
   files), `DataStats.kt` (NetworkStats → Tetra/Data/usage/<month>.<device>.jsonl hourly through SyncJob's job 4150, the
   first look back over the months Android kept; warnings 50/80/100 % and the day's budget; roaming notices with Android's
   data-roaming page; the 50 MB usage callback while Tetra lives), `DataScreen.kt` (DataActivity: Setup's ten pages, Usage
   with the ring, Day/Week/Cycle/Month/Year charts whose axis is a round step over the tallest bar, ‹ › through time, tap a
   bar for its apps, an app's page with foreground/background and Android's settings for it; Devices; ⋯ = Setup, live
   speed, stopwatch, Android's data settings), Settings › Data. Emulator: Setup walked through (Usage access's page opened
   and ticked itself on return), Android's own counts read back to 16 Oct, the charts, "Data: 50 % used" with a 100 KB test
   plan. **Not on the emulator**: the roaming notices (`gsm data roaming` did not make it roaming) — on the phone, abroad.
   Android's Data usage said 424 kB mobile for 16 Oct–; Tetra 439 KB (Tetra counts every UID, tethering included).
- [x] 3. Live speed (`DataSpeed.kt`): the status bar's icon (↓ big, ↑ small) once a second while the screen is on. **Its own
   low notification**: the listening one is "min", and Android shows no status-bar icon for those, so they could not be
   one. Emulator: the icon drawn and updating (↑59B seen).
- [x] 4. The files and sync: scope `data` (DriveScope, its waiting job 4151, desktop files.js SCOPES and APP_FOLDERS), Data
   hidden in Files on both. **The hotspot's share without logging intervals**: Android marks a Wi-Fi that is a phone's
   hotspot as metered (the hotspot says so over DHCP), and its statistics keep that: the tablet's `via` = its metered Wi-Fi
   bytes. NetworkManager does the same on the PC (seen 25 Oct: `GENERAL.METERED: yes (guessed)` on "Xiaomi 15").
   Tetra's own sync with the phone is left out (25 Oct, the user: "do these too"): on Android its own UID's bytes, on the
   computer each sync connection's bytes (sync.js → datacount.js `own`).
- [x] 5. (Drive 414f43d, branch `data`) Desktop: `datacount.js` (each minute /sys/class/net counters → this computer's month file,
   written every ten minutes and only once plan.json exists; Wi-Fi from `iw`; drops and "off the phone's hotspot"; sync's
   /data/wifi and /data/speed), `src/Data.tsx` (the plan, 30 days of all devices, this cycle by device, the hotspot box with
   who used most and the difference, this computer's Wi-Fi now, the drops). `test/datacount.test.js`; desktop 139/139, tsc
   clean; the page rendered with sample files (scripts/shot.js, a separate profile). Each month file starts with its device's
   name ({"deviceName":"Xiaomi 15"}, Android's own device name; the computer's host name), shown instead of the model code.
- [x] 6. Signal (`DataSignal.kt`): the meter (dBm, words, the 2-minute line, sound mode), Spots with rounds and the best round,
   speed to the computer, "Phone as hotspot" (the computer's own reading every 2 s; **the tablet cannot report to the phone**:
   it is paired only with the computer, and the hotspot keeps the computer and the tablet apart — the tablet shows its own),
   Around (scan, the least crowded channel, your own network left out, RTT marked). Emulator: the meter, a scan, a spot saved.
- [x] 7. Drops: Android's callbacks (mobile data lost, no service, no signal ≥ 30 s, a fall to 3G/2G; Wi-Fi lost and back
   within 10 min, very weak ≥ 30 s), the PC's own; listed in Signal and on the desktop page; a daily summary (off); red
   marks under the chart's bars (every device's). Nothing to see on the emulator (no drops); the real phone will show.
- [x] 8. Home's Data group (the art, the plan at a glance, Devices, Signal, Drops) and the icon: tools/applet-icons.py cuts
   Data.png's dark corners with a rounded-square mask; launcher background #17191D; Settings › App icons: Tetra Data.
   Emulator: light and dark, phone and tablet width. Unit suite 644, 0 failing, 9 skipped (DataTest, DataSignalTest).
- [~] 9. On the real devices (25 Oct): the phone and the tablet installed (step 1's notes above), the phone's numbers next to
   Nova's (6 % apart, the figure typed). **The computer**: desktop 0.6.0-beta.14 (Drive 9c05f58) installed by the user
   (`sudo apt install ./…deb`), restarted 09:21; its first file at 09:30: 74 MB Wi-Fi, 27.8 MB of it over the phone's
   hotspot — the other ~46 MB its own sync with the phone (the speed test's 40 MB among them), left out as designed. From
   the phone: "Phone as hotspot" read "Computer: −16 dBm · 162 Mb/s · Xiaomi 15"; speed to the computer ↓ 192 · ↑ 22 Mb/s.
   Left: the tablet's files reaching the phone and the computer (it was not connected when synced), a week of drops,
   roaming on a trip; the span-chip fix (d780018) goes with the next phone install. Merging both branches waits for the user.
- [x] 10. (the user, 25 Oct: "why do I have to go through Setup on the tablet? why does it not sync?"; "if it is just hotspot, write
   Hotspot") The tablet had last reached the computer at 04:12, before the plan existed; and **after an install on the phone
   its hotspot blocks the devices on it from each other (the phone and the computer still talk) until the hotspot is turned
   off and on** (the user) — the phone's, not Tetra's. Now: Data asks the computer for its part when it opens, the
   quarter-hourly look and the computer's nudge carry `data`, the computer nudges when plan.json changes; a tablet never
   offers Setup ("the phone's plan arrives with Local Sync") and Home's slot says "Hotspot 70 GB". **Hotspot is its own
   kind** beside Mobile and Wi-Fi (orange): per app (`net: hotspot` rows from Android's metered flag, Tetra's own sync left
   out), per 2-hour slot for yesterday and today (one summary per slot: Android's hourly history has no metered flag), in
   the charts, the legend, the app rows, Devices, and the computer's page. Emulator: a September with Mobile 4.5 · Hotspot 36 ·
   Wi-Fi 20 GB. Not yet on the tablet (not connected) nor the computer (needs a beta.15 package).
- [x] 11. (the user, 25 Oct: "the signal tab is a wall of text"; "giving info, not … auto fix everything"; "add the LAN option — Ethernet —
   to recognise when I connect it and compare speeds and losses"; "the Signal tab should have its own tabs at the top"; the Network
   Cell Info and WiFi Analyzer apps as the picture) Signal has tabs: **Meter** (half-circle gauges for Wi-Fi — hotspot or Ethernet
   said — and mobile: RSRP, 4G/5G, operator, band with the location right, RSRQ/SINR; the two minutes as a line; the sound as an icon;
   **the computer** card: how it is connected now, Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and **Test speed and loss** — 20 MB each way and 20 pings,
   each result keeping how both ends were connected, the last ten), **Analyzer** (WiFi Analyzer's channel graph: a hill per
   network, its name and a rough distance on top, the dBm scale and every channel; 2.4/5 GHz; then short advice cards — a quieter
   channel, 2.4 vs 5 GHz, how good it is here and what weakens it, busy air — information only), **Spots** (cards with bars),
   **Drops** (by day). Explanations behind (i). The computer: an Ethernet cable is recognised (`ethernet-on/off` lines), counted
   apart (`eth`), and reported to the phone. DataMeterTest; unit 649, desktop 140. Emulator: the gauges and the graph.
   **On the devices (25 Oct 10:17)**: the phone installed (tools/phone-install.sh, Android Auto approved again; data backed up to
   Coding/backups/phone-20261025-1016); the computer on beta.15 (the user's apt install), restarted. The phone's Meter: Mobile 5G (with
   4G) −115 dBm, Fair, NOVA · B3, RSRQ −17; Wi-Fi "not on Wi-Fi" (it is the hotspot); the computer "Wi-Fi −26 dBm · Xiaomi 15"; Test
   speed and loss ↓ 40 · ↑ 46 Mb/s · 63 ms · 0 % lost. Fixed after it (with the next install): the phone said "this one: Mobile" (now
   "its own hotspot") and the computer once "Wi-Fi 12 dBm" (a driver's positive reading right beside the phone: now just "Wi-Fi").
   The tablet was not on USB (only one device is seen at a time).
- [x] 12. (the user, 25 Oct, from the phone's screenshot) **Colours**: on the phone "Hotspot" had been its metered Wi-Fi — Android Auto's
   link to the car, 14 GB — while what it shared sat in Mobile; now on a phone Hotspot is what it shared (the tethering UID, "tether"
   hours apart) and the car's link is Wi-Fi; on a tablet/computer Hotspot is what they used through the phone. **The forecast**: the old
   white line was the cycle's running total on a hidden 0–300 GB scale over daily bars; now faint bars for the days to come, each the
   median of the same weekday over the last three weeks (six had pulled in a September of near-zero days: the user's hotspot use
   began 4 Oct), and a dashed average line; the running total kept in a chart of its own (**The cycle so far**, 0 → the limit,
   the forecast dashed); **This cycle in numbers** (average, workdays · weekends, busiest day, the hotspot's and Wi-Fi's share);
   **For your plan** (the pace and the day the limit would come, the hotspot's share and what fills it, weekends, the top app's
   background or Play Store updates, the busiest day — information only); (i) on each; the top ten apps and **All apps and services**.
   **By app everywhere**: the computer counts each program's TCP bytes (`ss -tinp`, no root; QUIC/UDP calls and video as "Other");
   the chart's **Kinds | Apps**; the phone's Hotspot row opens ▾ into the devices and their apps. Pages visited: left out — browsers
   tell no other program what a site used (a small local extension of our own could, later). On the phone 11:00 (the 6-week forecast
   still: 145 GB); the 3-week forecast on the phone at 11:17: 177 GB by 3 Nov, the faint bars 4–8 GB around the 6.8 GB average.
   The desktop's beta.16 (per program) installed by the user 11:19 and restarted: Claude 12 MB, Chrome, Firefox, Thunderbird, Viber, "Other"
   6 MB in its first minutes — and adb and Android Auto's head unit (the phone on USB) counted as hotspot. beta.17 (Drive): connections to
   the computer itself are not counted, to the local network (the phone, the tablet) are Wi-Fi; built, to install.
- [x] 13. (the user, 25 Oct, from the computer's page: "Xiaomi 15" four times; "Android Auto has its own Wi-Fi … make it Android Auto";
   "can we do better on desktop"; "make sure there is a cleanup, no garbage left behind") **Sync's conflict copies**: the phone's month,
   rewritten while the computer sent the last one back, came back as "2026-10.24129PN74G (2)/(3)/(4).jsonl" (history: 11:00, 11:11,
   11:18), each read as another phone. Now no reader takes a "(n)" copy, and every device (and the computer) removes them; the cause
   in the sync engine is left to look at apart. **Android Auto** its own kind (teal) on the phone: its metered Wi-Fi (`via` on a phone).
   **Cleanup**, once a day: the copies, half-written ".tmp" files, the warnings of cycles before the last two and day passes over 30
   days, the phone's own old "hotspot" hours, a month's per-app and hourly detail after 13 months (its days stay); the hourly job
   cancelled and the live speed stopped when Data is no longer used; the computer: the same for its files, its writes under a dot
   name. **The computer's page as the phone's**: the ring, Kinds | Apps with the faint forecast and the average, the cycle chart,
   the numbers, the tips, the apps (top ten, all, the Hotspot ▾ by device and app), the devices, the connection, the drops; (i) on
   each. Drive 3139ff3, beta.18 built; Android not installed (another session is using the phone).
- [x] 14. (25 Oct 12:58) main (Contacts' lazy loading, call history) merged into claude/data-plan, then installed on the phone (backed up;
   Android Auto approved). Found: the usage access had been taken away at ~11:27 (Android's own record), and **without it the hourly look
   rewrote this month's file without its days** — fixed: with no access the files are left exactly as they are (events wait). Nothing was
   lost: the access back (12:59), Android's counts wrote October again; the phone removed its 3 sync copies. The computer still had
   "(2)…(7)" (beta.16 does not clean): beta.18 removes them on start. Old desktop builds (beta.14–17) and older phone backups removed.
   13:06: Drive main (Contacts' latest) merged into `data` (c9b52f2), 0.6.0-beta.19 built (143 tests, tsc clean; both sides' code in the
   package), installed by the user over main's beta.14 and restarted: the "(2)…(7)" copies gone on start; the computer holds the phone's
   restored October (25 days, 128.5 GB mobile, 119.3 GB hotspot); its per-program lines go on (today's adb/head-unit rows from beta.16 stay).
   The user: "empty space, no scroll, content out of reach" → the page scrolls (the app's page-scroll) and fills the window, two columns
   when wide, one when not; checked at 1920, 1400, ~1000 and ~780, top and end; beta.20 (Drive 16923df) installed 13:13 and restarted.

### The house map — how it would work (not built: the user, 25 Oct, "it just seemed interesting how it works")
- **Realistic with phones**: draw the floor, walk and tap where you stand, the readings coloured over the plan (a heat map);
  a simple radio model (signal falls with distance, each wall costs some dB) fitted to the readings guesses the best router
  spot. NetSpot and others do this.
- **"From many devices and the signal's noise you see the obstacles, dirty, not a photo"** — that is real research:
  *radio tomographic imaging*. Many radios around a room (tens of them), every pair measuring the signal between them; each
  obstacle or person weakens the links that cross it, and a blurry picture of where things are is worked out from which
  links got weaker — like a CT scan, with radio. Better versions use *channel-state information* (CSI: the signal per
  sub-carrier, not just one strength number), which shows even a person breathing.
- **Why not with Tetra's three devices**: three devices give three links (or three to the router) — a handful of lines across
  the house, not the hundreds a picture needs; phones and ordinary Linux Wi-Fi drivers give one strength number (RSSI), not
  CSI (CSI needs special chips/firmware: research Wi-Fi cards, ESP32 boards, rooted phones with patched firmware). Walking
  the phone around gives many readings over time, and obstacles do show as weaker "shadows" behind them — that is the most a
  phone's map would show: where the signal is weak, not what is there.
- Seeing people through walls is the "spy thing"; Tetra does not do it.

### Later / maybe
- A **battery applet** — set aside by the user (25 Oct: "a different applet, another time or maybe never").
- The house map above; per-SIM split (with a second SIM); a "devices on my network" scan; an offline vendor table; a Quick
  Settings tile ("41 / 300 GB").

### Questions for the user
1. The old F-Droid app: Data Monitor (drnoob)? Anything in it to keep that is not above?
2. The icon — the user made it, 25 Oct: `Assets/DataMeter.png` (a lime gauge and bars on near-black).
3. Colour — from the icon: lime #A1F81A, the launcher background its charcoal (unless the user says otherwise).
4. The plan — answered 25 Oct: a Setup page; the user's is unlimited with a fair-use limit (~300 GB; Setup asks the number
   and the renewal day).
5. Live speed — answered 25 Oct: yes.
6. The house map — answered 25 Oct: not built; Spots in the meter instead.
7. The hotspot — answered 25 Oct: phone − (tablet + PC) = the difference, and who used most. Still open: "Phone as hotspot" in
   Signal needs the PC and the tablet on with Tetra for the minutes the phone is moved around — fine?
8. Roaming — answered 25 Oct: a day pass outside the EU (€15 / 300 MB) and a reminder to turn data roaming off.

## The user's original wishlist (Sept 2026, unchanged)

- The desktop and Android notes we made work like a charm
- I want to make the same thing (replasment of keep) but for google Drive
- the same functionality of Notes with the sync fuction on deferent networks, but with a file manager files and folders, tags, 
- the program will setup a local folder "Drive" like the sync thing does but I dont want the coplex UI, permitions and stuff.
- We could have a file hystory, a .history copy of all files edited on the computer, with a setting for how meny edits back disabled, 5,10,100. Time based check for changes every 5/10/15min
- sync progerss bar, files remaining.
- smart popup keep rename replse, like a file manager
- open all files with local programs this app will do nothing more than sync and organize in tags folders and "backup"
- I would like to have an Android and Linux version
- an extra thing I would like on the android side is document scanning with filtering, marking, page detection with save as PDF or open document.
- a small algorithm that can detect duplicates and organize in to proper folders after analizing the stracture or sugest deletions, (thats an Idea, it could be an algorithm or a small AI) for example when I scan a document and I name it with a number and date and name it Αίμα ή Αιματολογικές I would like for it to automaticaly sugest the correct folder where the other fiels of the same name are. So I don't have to change location.
- And later I would like it to have a photo viewer so I can get rid of my Google Photos as well. so 2 tabs at the bottom files/photos something like that.
- Did I say on option to set pholder location  at the beginig (on android will be localstorage thing/LocalDrive)
- Take a look at the nots app and take what you need.
- I made a git repo https://github.com/kalotrapezis/Drive, https://github.com/kalotrapezis/Drive-Android
- USB drive handling for Android.
- Automatic Backup ones the app detects a spesific predeterment USB device name.
- Files tab ( File manager - Local Google Drive) Photos tab (Google Photos Galery with metadeta and basic edditing)
- Photo Import (From Google Takeout, file muging handling, show, edit)

Files

Photos
Google Photos Clone without the Google stuff.
Photo gallery with day,month,year pinch in and out to change, or zoom
Collections, New (), Search, Notifications,
Documents are an analysed local collection; see `AI_COLLECTIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Collections examples (camera, viber, pictures, documents, downloads, messemger, moveis, videos)
Filters by file types, favorites, new files, Private, tags, resicle bin, screenshots.
To me it looks a Photo Gui file manager so Its not that deferent.
What could we add? document detection, Face detection, Symantic search? Like clouds, sky, smile face, (system tags) for the search.
Open in Photo galery mode, Photo galery Icon to open directly there.

See what do we need to borrow from the dirve app for the photos app vew thing.
