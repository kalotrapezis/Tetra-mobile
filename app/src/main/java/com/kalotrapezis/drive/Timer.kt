/*
 * Tetra's Timer (Plan.md § Timer). A timer is one small JSON file in Tetra/.System/Timer/Shared (~/Tetra/Files/Timer on the computer),
 * synced as files are, at once (DriveScope "timer"). Each device counts down by itself from the end time in it, so they
 * all show the same time left without any traffic while it runs; Start, Pause, Resume, Stop and OK each write the file
 * once and push it. The same format on the desktop (desktop/timer.js), so Claude can read or start one by hand:
 *
 *   {"id":"k3f9a2","seconds":300,"label":"","state":"running","ends":"2026-10-18T16:05:00Z","left":0,"rev":1,"by":"Tablet","pinned":false}
 *
 * state: running (counts down to `ends`), paused (`left` seconds remain), stopped. `pinned`: the card stays when it is
 * stopped or done, ready to start again (the user, 18 Oct: "a pin at the top left"); the trash takes it away. `rev` goes up by one at each change and
 * the highest wins (equal: stopped, then paused, then running), so clocks a few seconds apart never decide anything.
